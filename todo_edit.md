# todo list for editing blog_posts

This is a todo list for what I want to get done when it comes to editing in general. The process of updating this list is to have things broken down by category and for each category have items for each post. In the header of each item I have the date that I completed the item for the post, with the name of the post, and also some quick note as to why I want to edit that post such as being one, no links, interesting topic, ect.

So something like this for an item

```
### ( done 10/19/2021 ) - js-onvisibilitychange ( no internal links )
* (done) edit post to 1,800+ words
* (done) have 5+ internal links for the post
* (done) todo list in test vjs folder
* (done) readme file in test vjs folder, and links to post
```
