## Fresh by month

For this express app I wanted something that will help me get an idea of how fresh content is on a per month basis. The reason being that I have noticed that certain collections of content are preforming better than others in organic search. Collections of content on a per category basis, but also on a per yyyy/mm basis also.

So this application just runs over all my content and complies a list of items one for each yyyy/mm pattern when it comes to the year and month that the content was first published. A freshness factor is then found for each depending on the number of posts, and when each post was last updated. This can then be used to help me make decisions on where I should be placing my attention when it comes to updating old content.
