# blog_posts scripts folder

These are a bunch of scripts that I use to make sense of the current state of the collection of my content. So far there are just scripts for things like knowing what the total site wide word count is, and how fresh a collection of content is and so forth.

## apps folder

These are a number of express apps that can be started as a server on a given port. I can then view and use the app from a web browser window.

## cli

A number of basic command line interface tools.

## old

A place to park old scripts that I may delete at some point in the future as I clean things up a bit here.
