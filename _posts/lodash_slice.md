In native jaavScript there is the Array slice method that will return a new array from another arary without mutating the array in place. There is also yet another method in the core javaScript Array prototype object called splice that does more or less the same thing as Array slice only it will mutate the array in place. This however is a post on the array slice method in lodash that is not just a refernce to the native Array slice method.
