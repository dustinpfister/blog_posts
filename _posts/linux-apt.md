The Advanced package tool, or [apt for short command in Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APT_%28software%29) is the standard go to software package manager in Debian Linux as well as just about any Linux Distribution Based off of Debian. For the most part if I want to install, uninstall, or update software in a Debian Based system I will want to do so at least in park by way of apt.
