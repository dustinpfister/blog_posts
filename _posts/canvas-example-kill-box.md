While wasting some time scrolling threw you tube I can across a [video on how to make a kill box](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8fsjNjbz8Y) in a game called [RimWorld](https://store.steampowered.com/app/294100/RimWorld/). I have found the video, other videos like it, and the game itself interesting even though I have nit played it myself just yet. This has inspired me to start a canvas [canvas example](/2020/03/23/canvas-example/) of my own where I will be playing aorunf with many of the things that where talked about in the video, because I think making just a simple striped down game based around this might prove to be a little fun.
