The [javaScript throw](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/throw) statement can be used to internationally throw a user-defined exception. It can be used as a way to stop execution of a javaScript program in the event that some kind of essential condition is not in order.
