In this post on [Phaser ce](https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser-ce/) I will be covering some examples of making a collection of sprites using Group.create. There is also Group.add that can be used to add sprites, as well as many display objects as well, however in this post the emphasis will be just on sprites.
