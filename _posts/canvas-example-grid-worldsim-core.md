I want to start making at least a few more [canvas examples](/2020/03/23/canvas-example/) that are the kind of example that I will be coming back to a few times. In other words the kind of canvas example that might prove to be a bit more that just a center piece to write about in a blog post before moving on to the next thing. I as happy with how my [grid gradient canvas example](/2020/03/26/canvas-example-grid-gradient/) came out as it is was a canvas example that I put a little more time and effort into than usual. The main reason why I liked working on it so much was the plug-in system. However that was just an eye candy type thing, it would be nice to start another canvas example that is something els like that only it is something maybe a little more interesting.

So this canvas example will be similar to the grid gradient example, but this time I will be aiming for the start of a world simulator type project.
