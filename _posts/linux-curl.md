the [Linux curl](https://www.mit.edu/afs.new/sipb/user/ssen/src/curl-7.11.1/docs/curl.html) command is a way to download a file from a given URL, but it is also a bit more than just that. It can also be used to make various kinds of http requests from the command line such a POST requests, and can also be used as an FTP client. So the curl command is a helpful little command to be aware of when it comes to getting data from a public URL, or anything to that effect outside of a web browser.
