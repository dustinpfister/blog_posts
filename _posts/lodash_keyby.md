If I am every in a stutaion in which I need to create an object with keys that are generated from the properties of objects in an array I can use the [lodash](https://lodash.com/) [\_.keyBy](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.10#keyby) method to make quick work of that. The \_.keyBy method works a lot like \_.groupBy only it will only create one object for each key. In this post I will be going over some use case examples of \_.keyBy.
