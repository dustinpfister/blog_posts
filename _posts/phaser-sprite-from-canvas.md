So for todays post on the html5 game framework known as phaser ce, I will be writing about a way to go about making sprites form 2d canvas elements. This means making a sprite using the html 5 2d drawing context via a canvas element that has been made before hand elsewhere, or directly drawing to a new one. In any case the canvas can be used to make an instance of bitmap data that can then be used as a texture for a sprite, rather than an external image. I will not be getting into how to go about spritesheets for now, as I think that should be a whole other post.
