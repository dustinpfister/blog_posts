In this post I will be giving a quick overview of working with models in [mongoose.js](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/models.html). If you are not aware mongoose.js is a javaScript library to help make it easier to work with [mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/), a popular javaScript friendly databse solution that is used in node.js powered full stack apps.

## 1 - what to know

This is not a getting started post on node.js, or mongodb both of which are required to get anything out of this post. As of this writing I have written a getting started post on mongodb, but will not get into detail about everything in this post, just working with models with mongoose.
