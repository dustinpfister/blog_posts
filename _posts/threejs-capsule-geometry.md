There are many built in geometry constructors in [threejs](https://threejs.org/docs/#manual/en/introduction/Creating-a-scene) that can be used to create an instance of buffer geometry by way of calling a function and passing a few arguments to define certain aspects of the geometry that is created by way of a [javaScript constructor function](/2019/02/27/js-javascript-constructor/). One such option that I will be writing about today is the [capsule geometry constructor](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/geometries/CapsuleGeometry).
