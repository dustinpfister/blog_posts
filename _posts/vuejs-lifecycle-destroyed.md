I have been neglecting my content on vuejs, so to help get me in gear for changing that I thought I would write a quick post on the [vue destroyed](https://vuejs.org/v2/api/#destroyed) life cycle hook as a way to continue expanding on vuejs. There are several other life cycle hooks that are worth mentioning also such as the create, mounted, and updated hooks, so it makes sense that I should write one where I am focusing on the destroyed hook.
