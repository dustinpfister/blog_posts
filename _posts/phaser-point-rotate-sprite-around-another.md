So far this week I have been expanding my content on [Phaser ce](https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser-ce/) with the Point Class. This is a very helpful Class that helps with common issues that developers run into when dealing with points in a 2d space. In this post I will be writing about the Point.rotate methods, that can be used to rotate a sprite around another sprite, or any object that has exposed x, and y properties for that matter. This should be fun, so lets get into it.
