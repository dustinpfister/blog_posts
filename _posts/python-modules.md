In the past few weeks I have been making an effor to start learning python, and as such I should start getting into how to star making some kind of real project with python at some point. With that said I should start to learn the basics of how to go about creating modules with python. So in this post I will be going over the basics and more when it comes to modules, and packages in python as I have come to know it thus far.
