One core feature of Bash that I have been using all the time when writing [bash scripts](/2020/11/27/bash-scripts/) thus far is Parameter Expansion. There are several froms of Paramater expansion but they all have to do with how to go about creating values for variables and strings to be used with commands. There is the basic braces expansion that is used as a way to seperate a variable name from the rest of a string value, as well as prefrom something know as variable indirection more on that later.

There are also several other froms of paramater expansion, each of which might desirve there own post actually. However I often have a centeral post on topics such as this where I at least cover the basics of each, so this will be that kind of post when it comes to the various forms of paramater expansion in bash.
