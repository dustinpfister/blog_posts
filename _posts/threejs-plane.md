In [three js](https://threejs.org/) there are a lot of built in constructors for making quick geometries that can be used with a materials in a mesh. One of these is for plane geometry that is just flat 2d plane. The three plane constructor allows for setting the width and height, but also a count for section width, and section height as well.
