When it comes to making graphics with javaScript there are a number of options these days, such as the 2d canvas drawing api. However in this post I will be writing about a vector rather than raster base alternative called [Scalable Vector Graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics) or just svg for short.

## 1 - javaScript svg graphics basics

In this section I will be just starting out with the basics of svg graphics. There is creating svg graphics inline in html itself, and then there is having an external svg file that can then be loaded into the html via and object tag.
