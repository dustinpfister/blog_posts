In lodash there is the words method that can be used to quickly prefrom lexical analysis tokenization of a string. In other words the lodash words method is used to split a string into an array of words. In some cases this could be easily done with the split method, but it is not always so cut and dry. There are text samples that might contain certain characters that are to be cut out or included in the process for example. So that being said there is a need for some kind of Tokenizer method that is better suited for the task of creating an array of words from a text sample.
