I have made a habit of writing a post on the subject of bogging in general rather than javaScript, and javaScript related topics at the start of a new year. No buddy really seams to read these, but thats okay its more for my sake anyway because it is important for me to know where this site is going, and what the next move should be moving forward.

A course change of sorts is needed here, and after giving this some thought I have come to the conclusion that I need to focus more on just one or two general topics rather than trying to gain ground everywhere.

<!-- more -->

## 1 - Focus on something fun so I do not end up hating what I have come to enjoy.

## 2 - Focus on lodash and functional programing topics for the sake of focusing on what is actually working for me.
