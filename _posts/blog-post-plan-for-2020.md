I have made a habit of writing a post on the subject of bogging in general rather than javaScript, and javaScript related topics at the start of a new year. No buddy really seams to read these, but thats okay its more for my sake anyway because it is important for me to know where this site is going, and what the next move should be moving forward.

A course change of sorts is needed here, and after giving this some thought I have come to the conclusion that I need to focus more on just one or two general topics rather than trying to gain ground everywhere. My best preforming content seems to be on lodash and functional programing, but much of the content is thin, and desires more attention so that should be one topic at least for that reason. The other topic should be something fun, original, and interesting that might help to improve retention.

## 1 - Focus on something fun so I do not end up hating what I have come to enjoy.

I have been fiddling with javaScript for well over ten years now, and I think that it is long past time to start and maintain some kind of long term project outside of this blog, and the simple code examples that I make for each post. The long term project should be something where the intention is more in line with doing something that is fun, original, and novel rather than just doing something purely for the sake of gaining traffic or money.

In recent days I have been writing more content on canvas, and threejs. These collections of content are not pulling in a lot of trafic compared to other collections, but they are topics that I find to be fun.

## 2 - Focus on lodash and functional programing topics for the sake of focusing on what is actually working for me.
