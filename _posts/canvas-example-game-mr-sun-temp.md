I am going to try something new when it comes to todays [canvas example](/2020/03/23/canvas-example/) post, I am not going to just start a whole new example from the ground up. Often I do borrow a little code here and there from other examples, and projects when and where doing so is called for. However today I am going to just copy the whole source code of my Mr sun example at version 0.1.0 and start from there by just adding a few plugins to it, and making any changes that are needed to the source in the process if any.

So this way I am not starting over from the beginning, but if I need to I can make some changes that will not effect the other project. I can however add them to it later on if I feel as though such changes should be added.

Anyway this canvas example will then be a continuation of sorts on my Mr Sun game that I think might have some potential if I put a bit more time into it. In the game the player controls the position of a Sun object that effects the other word section objects that are centered around the sun object. In this post I am using the same core source code more or less, but I am adding two plug-ins to it that have to do with setting an updating a temp property for each section. In addition I am also starting another plug-in that has to do with fusion in the game, which I think would be another cool feature.
