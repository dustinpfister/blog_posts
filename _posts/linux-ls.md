The [Linux ls](https://www.thegeekdiary.com/basic-ls-command-examples-in-linux/) command is one of the first commands that a Linux user should be aware of when it comes to working in the command line. There is just knowing how to change the current working path, know what the current working path is, and also listing what is in a given path. So when it comes to listing what is in a given folder that is where the Linux ls comand will come into play.

There is much more to the Linux ls command beyond just listing what folders and files are in a given path location. There is listing hidden folders and files, and not doing so, there is listing file access permisions for a file, and there is not doing so. So there is not just typing the Linux ls command in and that is that, there are a few options that one should know about wheh it comes to Linux ls.

Also there is of course the limits of the linux ls command, it is not like Linux ls is the only option when it comes to getting lists of files in one or more paths. Theer are other commands such as the Linux find method, and also uisng Linux ls with other commands such as cat and grep to do a better job of finding what one might be looking for in a file system. SO lets get stared with the basics, and not so basics when it comes to using the Linux ls command.
