So it is time for yet another lodash post, this time on the \_.get method which oddly enough I have not wrote about yet. The \_.get method allows me to get a value from an object by passing the object, and then a path in string format to the value that I want. I can also pass an optional default value to the method in case the path to the value is undefined. It might also be a good idea to explore some other options for quickly getting values from an object in javaScript as well, so I will be writing about some vanilla js alternatives to \_.get as well.
