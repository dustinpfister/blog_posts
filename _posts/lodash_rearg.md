I have got into the habit of starting each month with one new [lodash](https://lodash.com/) post while the library is still on my radar. I can not say that I find myself actually using lodash that much and more, when I do it is often just one or two methods that I bother with in the framework.

Todays lodash post is on the \_.rearg method that can be used to create a new function with a function only rearranging the arguments for the function.
