One of my many canavs examples in the works is a game prototype that I am calling just simply Mr Sun. So far I just have a general idea of the kind of game that I would like to make, but many of the core logic features are still not togeather. So I thought I would make a simple vuejs example of the basic idea of the game, and have a few menus to switch between. The focus of this vuejs example will be to not make the game a canvas project, but more of a front end project in general where I am using vuejs as a framework to pull everything togeather.
