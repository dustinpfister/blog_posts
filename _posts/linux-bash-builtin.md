In Linux bash defines a number of built in commands, there is also the [builtin command](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/builtin-command-in-linux-with-examples/) itself which is also a built in command of bash. This builtin command is usful for createing functions in bash scripts that have the same name as a built in command. However there is also the question of what the built in commands are and how to go about confirming if a command is built in or not. So in this post I will be going over some basic examples of the builtin command, but I will also be doing a general overview of all the built in commands in bash.
