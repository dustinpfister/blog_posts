So this is another post on [canvas examples](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial), and for this post it will be about some basics with animations using canvas. Making animations with canvas can be a fun, and rewarding experience and is definitely and example of the fun side of javaScript. In addition in some situations animations can also be helpful as well as a way to express data, or show how something works. There are many canvas frameworks out there, but for now I will be sticking to just plain old native client side javaScript by itself here.
