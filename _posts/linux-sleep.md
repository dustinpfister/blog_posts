The [Linux sleep](https://linux.die.net/man/3/sleep) command can be used as a way to go about [setting a delay between the execution](https://linuxhint.com/sleep_command_linux/) of commands. This might prove to be useful when writing a [bash script](/2020/11/27/linux-bash-script/) and I want to set a delay for each each time a loop is in effect as I can call it over and over again in the body of a while loop for example.
