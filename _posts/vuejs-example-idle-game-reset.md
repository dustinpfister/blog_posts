This week I am taking another look at my viewjs content and starting to edit and expand this week starting with a bunch of examples on making an idle game with just vuejs, and vanilla javaScript. I have made a few other posts on this topic starting with just working out the very basics whenit comes to manual production or resources. I then moved on to additional topics that include production over time, and starting an upgrade system. There is just one more basic feature that I think all idle games should have and that is having some kind of reset point system.
