This post is about working with a Schema with [mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/), using [mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html) as a mongodb client. A [database Schema](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_schema) can be thought of as a blueprint of sorts for a Model that will be used to create many instances of said Model that will compose a collection. So in other words a Shema is a formal way of setting up the format of a database item, mainly its properties, and what types each property should be. This post will be a quick overview of how to define and use a Schema in with mongoose.
