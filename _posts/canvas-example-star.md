Time for yet another [canvas example](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial) this time I think I will do a quick example of drawing a star. There are many ways of doing so with a canvas html element, many solutions that I see involve making a draw method that will draw a star. However I think a better way of doing so is to create a method that will create an array of points, and then have a draw method that will just render that array of points.
