[Lodash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lodash) is a JavaScript library that provides over three hundred modular utility functions to help work with arrays, functions, and objects in general. Many of the methods are [functional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) in nature conforming to rules that are constant with the concept of a [pure function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function). It is true that many of the functions in lodash, and underscore the older library from which it was forked, are now part of core javaScript itself. However many of the functions in lodash to work a little differently, and there is still some people out there using older browsers. In addition many of the utility methods are still not part of core javaScript at all, so it is not necessarily a dead library.
