The [Linux rm](https://linux.die.net/man/1/rm) command is how to go about deleting files from the command line. The basic use case of the command is simple enough I just need to call the command and pass the path to the file that I want to delete ad the first and only argument. However things might get a little complicated when it comes to things like deleting files recursively, of running into probelms with things that have to do with files access permissions.
