This post will be on the ins and outs of [event objects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event) in client side javaScript. There are several properties and methods that are of key interest many others such as the target property that is a reference to the element where the event happened, and the prevent default method that will stop default browser behavior for certain types of events like mouse and touch events. I forget about things like prevent default now and then too, so maybe writing a lengthly post about that and the event object in general will help me to remember better.
