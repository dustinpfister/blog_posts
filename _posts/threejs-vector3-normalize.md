The [Vector3 class](/2018/04/15/threejs-vector3/) in [threejs](https://threejs.org/docs/#manual/en/introduction/Creating-a-scene) has many prototype methods one of which is the [Vector3 normalize](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/math/Vector3.normalize) method. Calling the normalize method of a Vector3 instance will preserve the direction of the vector, but it will reduce the euclidean distance of the vector to a length of one. A Vector with a euclidean distance of one is often referred to as a unit vector, and what is nice about this kind of vector is that it can esley be scaled up by just multiplying the values by a desired magnitude that is any value other than one.

## 2 - Basic Vector3 normalize example

In this basic example I am creating an instance of THREE.Vector3 that is not normalized, and then just calling the normalized method of the Vector3 instance to get a normalized vector.

```js
(function () {
 
    // scene
    var scene = new THREE.Scene();
    scene.add(new THREE.GridHelper(7, 7));
 
    var dir = new THREE.Vector3(-20, 0, 0);
    // NORMALIZING DIR FROM -20,0,0 to -1,0,0
    dir.normalize();
    console.log(Object.values(dir)); // [-1, 0, 0]
 
    // cube
    var cube = new THREE.Mesh(
            new THREE.BoxGeometry(1, 1, 1),
            new THREE.MeshNormalMaterial());
    // MULTIPLYING DIR BY 2
    cube.position.copy( dir.multiplyScalar(2) );
    scene.add(cube);
 
    // camera, render
    var camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(50, 4 / 3, .5, 1000);
    camera.position.set(8, 10, 8);
    camera.lookAt(0, 0, 0);
    var renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer();
    renderer.setSize(640, 480);
    document.getElementById('demo').appendChild(renderer.domElement);
    renderer.render(scene, camera);
 
}
    ());
```
