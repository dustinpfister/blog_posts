So for todays post a [node cli](/2019/10/23/nodejs-cli/) tool example from my on my node_cli_tools project I will be writing about a quick tool that I put together that can be used to convert a plain text file to a hex format. This kind of tool might come in handy when it comes to creating a collection of content that I want to store in a format that is not necessary encrypted, but is just in a format that is not human readable. The main use case is that I just want a simple tool that will convert markdown files for example into a format that just makes it so the content is not indexed by Google bot, but can easily be converted back to a plain text format.
