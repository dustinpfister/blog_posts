This threejs project examples post is on a javaScript file that I am using to help me with the process of making what I would call a count down, or timer video. This is just simply a kind of video where there is a count down that starts from when the video starts from a given start time such as 30 seconds, and then counts down to 0. When 0 is reached the video is over, or there is a little additional time that is an alarm sound or something to that effect.

When it comes to making videos for these blog posts using threejs as well as some of my own additional software, I am always thinking about what it is that I should do different with them. For now as of this writing the existing state of affairs is to just continue with simple demo videos that just showcase what the JavaScript code for a given post on threejs will do. Once again I think that this will be the case here, but maybe with only just one video. I can use the countdown module to create one of my usual 30 second demo videos that has been the pattern thus far, however I can also use it to make videos that are any given time length long. So this will then be a great tool for my other collection of video content thus far which is just a general experimental collection of content.
