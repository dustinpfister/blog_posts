I have written many posts on [javaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) related topics, but so far oddly enough I have not written a getting started post on javaScript until now of course. In this post I will offer some suggestions for getting started with javaScript that you can do right now from your desktop computer, without installing any additional software assuming you have a web browser and text editor installed, and in some cases you just need a browser to get started.

## 1 - What to know

I will not be covering everything there is to know of course, learning javaScript as with any programing language takes a whole lot of time and patience, as well as dedication. To get started with javaScript all that is needed is a computer with a fairly up to date web browser. In this post I will be writing about very simple examples that can be entered into javaScript console of a web browser.

### 1.1 - Be sure to be using an up to date web browser

In this post I am using Google chrome 70.x, and am using examples that can be copied and pasted into the javaScript console. The reason why is that I think the javaScript console is a good way to introduce people to javaScript that have no background with it at all. All that is needed is a web browser, and in addition you do not need to set up and account of any kind as well.

## 2 - Using the javaScript console

To use the javaScript console in chrome I just need to do a ctrl+shift+j on my keyboard when I have a new tab open. This can also be done at any site as well, and the scripts that are entered operate within the domain of that site. Which is why you get a warning if you do it from certain sites like facebook. In this post I will just be covering some simple examples that do not do anything malicious, however certain forms of hacking is possible from the javaScript console. So do not copy and paste code form just anywhere into it, unless you know what it does.
