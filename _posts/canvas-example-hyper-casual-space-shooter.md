I have made a few [canvas examples](/2020/03/23/canvas-example/) so far, but I think it is time to try something new. I strated one other canvas example thus far that I have called a kind of [hyper casual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyper-casual_game) type game called [to the black](/2020/09/19/canvas-example-hyper-casual-to-the-black/). The idea that I had in mind for that example was very basic, I just wanted a ship that goes forward threw space at a given rate, and I have an estamate as to how long it would take for the ship to reach Max Safe interger.
