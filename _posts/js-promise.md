I have not yet got around to writing a post that is a general overview of [Promises in javaScript](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/master-the-javascript-interview-what-is-a-promise-27fc71e77261) just a whole lot of posts on various native methods of the Promise Object as well as various libraries and other native javaScript features surrounding the use of Promises. So then in todays post I will be putting and end to this by writing a post that will serve as a way to tie all of this together.

## 1 - JS Promise basics

To start off this post I will be taking a moment to write about some basics of Promises, as well as any and all related topics that might come up in the process of doing so. There is of course having at least some background when it comes to getting started with javaScript itself in general, as well as all kinds of various other topics that you should know before hand. As such I will not be getting into all the various little details that you show know before reading this, however I will be trying my best to keep things fairly simple in the basic getting started type section as always.
