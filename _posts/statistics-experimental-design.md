This week I think I will be getting back into [Statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics) for a while. I am not sure if I truly want to get into this subject, but it would seem that I have at least some interest in it when it comes to playing around with various statistcis when it comes to this website. Mainly when it comes to things like traffic, mean word count per post, orgainic traffic clicks per word, and so forth. However of course there are all kinds of other applactions when it comes to statistcis, so now and then I do a little more reading on the topic, and work out some code examples when it comes to a few things here and there.

In my travles online I have come accross an wikipedia artical on the topic of soemthing called [Experimental Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_of_experiments) that struct a nerve when it comes certian things I find myself writing about such as the topic of pure functions. Which promped me to look into some [additional resources on the open web](https://www.scribbr.com/methodology/experimental-design/) in an effort to gain at least a slighly better understanding of this general topic in statstics.

Whatever I call it somehting to this effect will come up sooner of later when it comes to starrying to play arouind with a few things when it comes to statstics. One of the first things that is required when it comes to doing something with data is to first have, well, some data. It is best to have some kind of real data to work with, with that said when it comes to my website for example there is google search console, and google anlytics that help provide some real data when it comes to traffic. In addition I have some of my own scripts that I can use when it comes to tabulating things like word count, mean word count over all, mean word count per category, and so forth. However when it comes to making some kind of. 

However what if I want to come up with some kind of _hypothesis_ ( or maybe I should just stick to the word _guess_ sense I am not much of a scientist at this point ) as to the outcome of some kind of action? For example say I take a collection of content that is of very poor quaility and invest a solid month of time writing new content while greatly imporving the quaility of the older content on top of it. Before I make such an inverstment of time I would like to try to find a way to know if there is a good chance that such an investment of time will end up being worth the effort. In that case I would want to make some kind of projection, based off of some real data, or failing that some kind of educated guess, or even a wild or random guess. This it would seem is where the topic of Experimental Design comes into play.
