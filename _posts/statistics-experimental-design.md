This week I think I will be getting back into [Statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics) for a while. I am not sure if I truly want to get into this subject, but it would seem that I have at least some interest in it when it comes to playing around with various statistcis when it comes to this website. Mainly when it comes to things like traffic, mean word count per post, orgainic traffic clicks per word, and so forth. However of course there are all kinds of other applactions when it comes to statistcis, so now and then I do a little more reading on the topic, and work out some code examples when it comes to a few things here and there.
