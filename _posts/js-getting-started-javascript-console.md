In just about any web browser there is a [javaScript console](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/console/javascript). This console can be used as a way of getting started with javaScript without installing any additional software beyond the web browser that you all ready have installed on your computer. No need to even look into editors and javaScript related plug-ins for such editors, no need for any expensive software or hardware. If you are reading this in a modern web browser such as chrome 70 or higher, that is running on top of a modern fully featured traditional desktop operating system such as windows 10, mac OSX or linux, then that is all that is needed. So lets start out with the javaScript console as a way to get started learning the javaScript programing language.

## 1 - javaScript console getting started

In this post I am using the [chrome devtools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/) javaScript console in [google chrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Chrome) 75.x. It might still be possible to use the javaScript console as a way to get started with javaScript coding in other browsers, but for the sake of the content of this post I was using chrome when I wrote this.
