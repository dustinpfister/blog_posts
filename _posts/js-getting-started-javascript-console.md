In just about any web browser there is a [javaScript console](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/console/javascript). This console can be used as a way of getting started with javaScript without installing any additional software beyond the web browser that you all ready have installed on your computer. No need to even look into editors and javaScript related plug-ins for such editors, no need for any expensive software or hardware. If you are reading this in a modern web browser such as chrome 70 or higher, that is running on top of a modern fully featured traditional desktop operating system such as windows 10, mac OSX or linux, then that is all that is needed. So lets start out with the javaScript console as a way to get started learning the javaScript programing language.

## 1 - javaScript console getting started

In this post I am using the [chrome devtools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/) javaScript console in [google chrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Chrome) 75.x. It might still be possible to use the javaScript console as a way to get started with javaScript coding in other browsers, but for the sake of the content of this post I was using chrome when I wrote this.
To open the javaScript console at any web page use Control+Shift+J and the javaScript console should appear. By default the console tab should be selected, if not for whatever reason select the console tab. There is a lot to cover when it comes to the devtools in chrome when it comes to the other tabs, but in this post I will just be covering some basics with the javaScript console.

### 1.1 - First line of javaScript

So lets getting started with javaScript in the google chrome javaScript console by just clicking in the console window and typing in a javaScript expression. The very first line of code could be something very simple like adding to numbers together, or concatenating a string by using the addition operator to add a number to a string.
