This will be a simple CLI Interface example that wil serve as a starting point for a nodejs project. I might make a few examples based of this actauly so I hope to get this at least somewhat solid before moving on to additional examples. First off the goal here is to create a custom command line interface that works like various command line tools like the nano text editor, or something to that effect. That is that I call a command, maybe pass some options, and then drop into a terminal based interface in which I need to use arrow keys to navagate, and type text, and keyboard shortcuts to move around.

When it comes to doing this sort of thing there are a number of packages to use to just get up and running with this fast, but this is not that kind of post. What I am doing here is a simple starting point that is just a little vanilla javaScript code and that is it.

## Conclusion

This week I think I will be writing a few new posts on nodejs to help break the habbit of not working on nodejs related stuff. I do seem to be moreinterested in front end javaScript alone these days, and also when it comes to writing the kinds of things that I once made with node I have learned a thing or two about bash, and python sense then.
