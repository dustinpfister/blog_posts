This will be a quick post on the [lodash has](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.11#has) method, a simple object method that can be used to check if an object has a certain path to it or not. This is one of many methods in lodash that accept a string form of a object path to a value. Another such method of note in lodash would be the [\_.get](/2018/09/24/lodash_get/), and [\_.set](/2018/12/04/lodash_set/) methods. This is not one of the most compelling methods in lodash, in fact when it comes down to it there are only really a handful that I find myself still  using in projects.

## 1 - lodash has in a nut shell

So the lodash has method can be used by just passing an object followed by a string that represents the path of a property of an object. In the event that the property is there it will return true, else it will not.

```js
let obj = {
    foo: {
        bar: {
            x: 40,
            y: 2
        }
    },
    dust: {
        in: {
            the: {
                wind: 'that is all we are'
            }
        }
    }
};
 
console.log( _.has(obj, 'dust.in.the.wind') ); // true
console.log( _.has(obj, 'dust.in.x') ); // false
console.log( _.has(obj, 'foo.bar.x') ); // true
```

So this object method can be used as a way to feature test if a path exist in an object and if not can be used with another method like the lodash set method to set the path.
