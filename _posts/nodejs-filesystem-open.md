So in most of my nodejs project I just use the fs.writeFile, and fs.readFile methods. With many of my projects just working with those methods get the job done just file. However of course there are more tools in the box, and sometimes it might be better to go with the fs.open method, and then methods like fs.write, and fs.read.
