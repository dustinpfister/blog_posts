There are a number of official camera controls that can be used with [threejs](https://threejs.org/) it is just that they are not built into the core of three.js itself. I wrote a post on one of these camera control options which was the orbit controls a long time ago, but I thought that I should take a moment to look into at least one of the other options to make use of in some examples such as the [three.js fly controls](https://threejs.org/docs/#examples/en/controls/FlyControls.dragToLook). So then this will be a quick post on use the official fly controls in a three.js project.
