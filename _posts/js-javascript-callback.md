In javaScript a [callback function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Callback_function) is often used as a way to define some logic that is to execute at some point later on rather than right at the moment. For example when I go to pass a function as an argument for the add [event listener](/2019/01/16/js-event-listeners/) function when in client side javaScript that can be thought of as a callback function. The code in the function will not run at that very moment, but it will when the event happens at which point the callback will fire, and I will have access to an [event object](/2020/07/23/js-event-object/) that contains into about the event. There is then all the various built in functions in nodejs that will take a callback also when it comes to sever side javaScript.

It would also seem that a callback is also used as an umbrella term for any function that is passed as an argument to another function that is used at some point or place inside the body of that outer function that is called. So there might be some overlap here with other terms that might come up such as [higher order functions, and closures](/2019/02/22/js-javascript-closure/).

JavaScript callbacks are often used with, or as a replacement for other options such as [promises](/2021/10/22/js-promise/). In many javaScript projects, code examples, and so forth I often encounter callbacks now and then so it is important to know a thing or two about them. In addition it is important to be aware of the drawbacks that callbacks often present, and why other options such as promises might prove to be a better option. So i this post I will be taking a quick looks at some callback examples.

## 1 - javaScript callback basics

The basic idea of a call back is that it is a function that will fire at a later time. This allows for additional code to execute in the mean time. For example say I have a function that accepts two arguments one is a delay, and another is a function to fire once that delay has elapsed.

```js
var delay = function (delay, cb) {
    delay = delay === undefined ? 0 : delay;
    cb = cb === undefined ? function () {}: cb;
    return setTimeout(cb, delay);
};
 
// 'no delay logs first'
delay(1000, function(){
    console.log('delay');
});
console.log('no delay')

```

The important thing to note here is that in this example the no delay message logs to the console first. So the execution of javaScript is not delayed. So this qualifies as a basic example of a callback in javaScript as it is a function that is to be called at a later time. This might not be the best example of a callback though so lets look at some additional examples.

## 2 - Node.js callback examples

When it comes to a node.js project callbacks come up a lot. They where used all the time in the early days of node.js as a way to define javaScript code that is to run after a task that will take some time is completed. They are still often used as one way of going about doing that sort of thing when needed.

### 2.1 - Using an fs module method

One of the most common examples of a callback in node.js examples might be with a method in the node.js file system module. Many of these methods have to do with reading or writing something to a local file system. These kinds of tasks can take a little time compared to doing something that involves just doing a little math. So one way or another it is necessary to define some code that will run which the task completes so that anything else that needs to happen is not put on pause while waiting for that to happen. So a callback is one way to go about doing that.

```js
let fs = require('fs');
 
// using readFile with a callback method
fs.readFile('basic.js', function (e, data) {
    if (e) {
        console.log(e.message);
    }
    if (data) {
        console.log(data.toString());
    }
});
 
// this will log first.
console.log('first!');
```

There are other ways of going about handling these kinds of situations such as with promises. When using callbacks all the time in more complex node.js projects this can quickly result in callback hell, a term which refers to situations in which there are many nesed callbacks.

### 2.2 - Callback hell in node.js

So say you want to get a list of files in a directory, then for each file get stats for each file. Once stats are obtained use the states object to find out if an item in the directory is a file or folder, and if so if it is a javaScript file. If the conditions are meet then read the file and log the javaScript code to the console.

Complex tasks like this can be done with the node.js file system module alone, but it often involves the use of more than one file system method each requiring a callback resulting in the so called callback hell.

```js
let fs = require('fs'),
path = require('path'),

root = path.resolve('./');

// read a root dir for files (using a callback)
fs.readdir(root, function (e, files) {
 
    if (files) {
 
        // for each file
        files.forEach(function (file) {
            let dir = path.join(root, file);
 
            // get stats for a file (another callback)
            fs.stat(dir, function (e, stats) {
 
                if (stats.isFile() && path.extname(dir).toLowerCase() === '.js') {
 
                    // read file (yet another callback)
                    fs.readFile(dir, function (err, data) {
 
                        // finally log javaScript code
                        console.log(data.toString());
 
                    })
 
                }
 
            });
 
        });
    }
 
});
```

There are ways of resolving this that involve the use of promises. In late versions of node.js (11.x) there is what is at the time of this writing experimental support for promises. For older versions of node.js there is npm packages like [fs-extra](/2018/01/08/nodejs-fs-extra/) that add promise support to the fs module.

## 3 - Concision

So in javaScript callbacks are one way to go about providing some code that is to run when a tack that is going to take a while completes. It is not the only option though and in many cases these days it might be a better idea to go with promises. There is the issue of having many nested calls in one callback after another that really can become a hell of sorts compared to the structure of what happens when using promises as an alternative.

However I do still find myself using closures all the time with many of my projects when it comes to defining a callback as just simply a function that is passed as an argument. Sure that is something that comes up all the time, and will continue to do so. Every time I use the Array.map prototype method or any similar method I pass a function as an argument to the map method that contains logic that is called for each element in an array that is used to create a new corresponding value for that array element. I work out option objects for arguments that take one or more properties that are functions that are used inside the body of the function that makes use of that said options object. So callbacks are hear to stay of course depending on how you go about what it is that you are labeling them I suppose.
