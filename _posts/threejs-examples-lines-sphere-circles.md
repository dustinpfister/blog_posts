When it comes to making lines in threejs I wanted to make a [threejs example](/2021/02/19/threejs-examples/) in which I have a collection of lines that form a sphere like shape. So the general idea is to make a javaScript module that has a create method that will return a group of lines, where each line is one circle that forms something that will look like a sphere. I can then also add a method that can be used to update the state of this group of lines with a new set of options as a way to make various kinds of animations.

## Sphere Circle Lines threejs example and what to know first

This is a post on some javaScript code built on top of the library known as threejs that has to do with making a collection of lines that look like a sphere. This is one of my many threejs project examples that I have made thus far that is for developers that have a fair amount of experience with javaScript and threejs and are now looking into ideas for projects. This is then not a post for people that are still fairly new with threejs, and as such I will not be getting into basic things that you should know about at this point. However in this section I will be going over a few things you might want to read up more on that are related to what I am doing here.
