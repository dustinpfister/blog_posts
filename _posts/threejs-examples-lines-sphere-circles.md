When it comes to making lines in threejs I wanted to make an example in which I have a collection of lines that form a sphere like shape. So the general idea is to make a javaScript module that has a create method that will return a group of lines, where each line is one circle that forms something that will look like a sphere. I can then also add a method that can be used to update the state of this group of lines with a new set of options as a way to make various kinds of animations.
