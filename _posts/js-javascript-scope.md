The [variable scope of a variable in javaScipt](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Scope) is the area in code where the variable is defined. If a variable is inside the scope of a section of code it is of use there, else it can not be accessed. Traditionally javaScipt had function level scope only, but these days there is block level scope as well. In this post I will be going over some of the ins and outs with javaScript variable scope both with the way this where, and how they are now.
