The [THREE.Curve base class](/2022/06/17/threejs-curve/) can be used as a way to create custom curve constructor functions, but one might need to even bother with that as there are a number of great built in curve constructor functions as well. In any case Curve objects, regardless if they are custom , or built in, are a great way to go about defining paths in 3d space. I am sure that they may also be useful for many other things in threejs such as creating the position attributes of geometry, but for now I am mainly focused on using curves to define paths that can be used to define the movement of objects over time.
