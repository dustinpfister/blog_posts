The [on blur](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/GlobalEventHandlers/onblur) event in javaScript is the opposite of the on focus event. A focus event fires when the user focuses on an element like a text input element by clicking on it or cycling to it with the tab key on a keyboard. So then a blur event fires when an element losses this focus, once it has been aqquired.
