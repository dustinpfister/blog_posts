In [javaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) one of the most important primitive values to work with is [booleans](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Boolean). To create a boolean there is the boolean literal, the Boolean object. In addition booleans can happen as a result of an expression as well. There are some tricks that I have picked up here and there when it comes to booleans, so I will be sure to write about everything that I know about in this post when it comes to Booleans with javaScript.

## 1 - What to know

This is not a getting started post on javaScript, in this post I am writing just about booleans and how they are used with programming tasks with javaScript. If you are new to javaScript you might want to start with my [getting started post on javaScript](/2018/11/27/js-getting-started/).

## 2 - A Boolean literal

For the most part if I want to set a boolean value I just set it using a literal. The true and false boolean literals can be used do do just this.

```js
var firstRun = true;
```
