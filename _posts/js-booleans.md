In [javaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) one of the most important primitive values to work with is [booleans](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Boolean). To create a boolean there is the boolean literal, the Boolean object. In addition booleans can happen as a result of an expression as well. There are some tricks that I have picked up here and there when it comes to booleans, so I will be sure to write about everything that I know about in this post when it comes to Booleans with javaScript.
