When it comes to my beta world collection of videos I have started a timer video project that involves a train that goes along a track. There is a lot that I like about this project, but also a whole lot that I would change if I where to start over. Anyway one thing about the project is that I have the land all as one big solid geometry, then I worked out a curve path for a train to go along on top of the single geometry in the single mesh. This seems to work okay, but if I where to start to make another video project like this, and then another, and so forth I would like to make some other kind of system for this. Mainly I do not think that I would want to have one solid geometry, but rather a collection of source objects to which I clone, and adjust one by one as a way to create an over all scene. So with that said this threejs project example is about a module that has some methods that can be used to create such a project.
