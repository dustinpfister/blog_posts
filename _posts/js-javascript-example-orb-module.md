Todays [javaScript example](/2021/04/02/js-javascript-example/) is going to be on a module that I have started a long time ago, but have come around to clean it up a bit because I might want to use it in a game in the near or distance future. The module has to do with and array of point values, and finding a simple ratio of those values, and using the ratio to set one of several kinds of types.
