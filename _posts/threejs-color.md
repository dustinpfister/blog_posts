When it comes ton[threejs](https://threejs.org/) it looks like I never got around to writing a quick post about some examples of the [THREE.Color](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/math/Color) constructor. This constructor can be used to create a class object instance that represents a specific color. When it comes to color in three.js there are a number of places here and there where I might want to use this constructor to create a color. Such as setting the background color, a fog color, and the plain color and emissive colors of a material.
