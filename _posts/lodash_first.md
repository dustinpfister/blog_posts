The lodash first method is just a simple convenience method for getting the first element of an array. So then this is one of those methods in lodash that make me question the worth of lodash a little. The reason being that it is not such a big deal to gust simply get the first element of an array with javaScript by itself. Well anyway I thought I would write a short post on lodash first and some related topics, but it goes without say that this is not something that should end up eating up a great deal of my attention.
