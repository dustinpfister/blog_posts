So in javaScript there are many different [kinds of functions](/2019/12/16/js-function/), and also how functions can be used. There is the nature of [constructor functions](/2019/02/27/js-javascript-constructor/) and how they are used as a way to create functions that are called off of an instance of that constructor. There are prototype methods like that of the array splice method that will mutate an array in place, and then there are other methods in the array prototype such as slice that will not mutate the source array, but instead return a new array without mutating the source array off of while array slice was called.
