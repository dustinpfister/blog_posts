There is a massive world of editors to use in Linux, many of which need to be used in a desktop enviorment. However there are also a lot of editors that are used in a bash command shell. There is of course vim which is one well know such editor, however if you are new to editing text in a bash shell it might be best to start with nano. Also I still like nano over others when it comes to a command line interface style text editor, so it is something that is not just for beginners.

There is just the very basuics of how to get started with nano, that is just opening up a file, or creating a file with it. However there is also using it as a way to end up with some text that is the result of another command via piping, and other little things about nano that might justafy writing a quick post on the editor. So in this post I will be going over every little detail that I think is worth mentioning when it comes to using nano as a test editor, and also some relateed topics that might also be worth mentioning here.
