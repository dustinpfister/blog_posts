Some may say that a good way to learn javaScript, or any programing language is to study the language itself, as well as various libraries that are written in the language. However maybe the best way to go about learning javaScript would be to just start making some fun, or useful [javaScript examples](https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/javascript-examples.php) that you can start to actually play with, or use to help solve some kind of problem.

## 1 - [Attack wave control system](/2021/03/31/js-javascript-example-attack-wave-control-system)

First off I have an attack wave control system that I might use in one or more canvas games, when it comes to my collection of canvas examples, and any other similar future project that revolves around the canvas element or some kind of game framework. The goal with this javaScript example was not to make a full, complete game, but is was to create a way to control the flow of waves of enemies units coming into a game world area. 

There are many games that follow a kind of system where a period of time goes by, and a wave of enemeis enters a game world area that must be completely destroyed.
