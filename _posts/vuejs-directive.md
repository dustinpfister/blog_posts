If you start getting into vuejs the concept of a [vue directive](https://012.vuejs.org/guide/directives.html) is something that will come up, and it is important to understand what they are, how to use them, and also how to [make them as well](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/custom-directive.html). If you have some background with angular chances are you will be able to get up and running with vue directives fairly fast. However in any case in this post I will be showing off some simple, and maybe not so simple vue directive examples.
