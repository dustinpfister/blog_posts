The [Linux wc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wc_%28Unix%29) command is one of many commands that I have become aware of when looking thru the [\/user\/bin](http://www.linfo.org/usr_bin.html) path for things to check out, and maybe write a thing or two about. This wc command can be used to get a word count of a text file where a word is a non-zero length string of charicters between whitespace.
