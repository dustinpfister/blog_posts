So the vue use global api method in vue.js is there to use plugins designed for vue.js. Vue.js can do a lot by itself, but chances are you are going to want to use at at least a few plugins as late versions of the framework even miss things like an http client. It seems like vue.js is following a more minimal approach with its design, pulling many features out of the framework itself, and leaving it up to the developer how to go about adding that feature.
