The javaScript Date constructor can be used to create Date objects that represent a single moment in time. In javaScript date objects use [Unix time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time), A system of time based on a number of seconds passed a fixed point in the past. In this post I will be covering some of the basics of javaScript Dates as well as maybe some more advanced related topics as well centered around time.
