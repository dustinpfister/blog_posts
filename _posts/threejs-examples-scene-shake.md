Today I made another [threejs example](/2021/02/19/threejs-examples/) this time a scene shake module that can be used to shake the whole [scene object](/2018/05/03/threejs-scene/). When I do so that way I just need to pass the scene object to a method that will apply the current state of a shake object to the scene object. One thing I will want to keep in mind with this is that I do not want to add the camera that I am suing to render the scene to the scene object, because if I do I can not see the shake as the camera will be relative to the scene. In the event that I do need to add the camera to the scene then the shake object can be applied to some other object in three.js that is based off of the [object3d class](/2018/04/23/threejs-object3d) other that the scene object such as a group, or a camera.

This shake module might then work out okay when it comes to adding some kind of screen shake effect to a three.js project. For the sake of trying to keep things short, simple and too the point, I did not go over board with feature for thus module. The core of the idea is that I just need a way to randomly move an object around within a range, or apply some other kind of logic to produce the shake effect.

## 1 - The shake module three.js example and what to know first

In this post I am writing about a module that works on top of three.js to provide a way to create and update a screen or object shake effect. This is not a [getting started type post on three.js](/2018/04/04/threejs-getting-started/), or any additional skills that are required in order to extract something of value from reading this. However in this section I will be briefly writing about a few things that you should know about before reading more.

### 1.1 - Version Numbers matter with three.js

When I made this shake module and the demos that make use of it I was using three.js version r127. In the future it is possible that the code examples here will break on newer versions of three.js as code breaking changes are made all the time to three.js. Always take care to note how old a post is, or any mentions of versions of external assets used when making use of code examples on the open web.

## 2 - The shake module

First off I will want to go over the shake module first before getting into any kind of demo that makes use of this module. This module had a public create method that I can use in a project to create an instance of a shake object, this object will contain data about the current state of the shake object. Main value of interest with the shake object are the active flag and values that have to do with the current intensity of the position and angle range of the shake effect.

After the create effect I have a roll effect which will change the current state of the instances of [Euler](/2021/04/28/threejs-euler/) and [Vector3](/2018/04/15/threejs-vector3/) that are used to [set the position of the object](/2022/04/04/threejs-object3d-position/) to which the shake object is applied to. And speaking of doing that I also have one more additional public method that is used to do just that apply the current state of shake object to a given object in three.js hat inherits from three.js. This object can be the scene object which is what I originally intended to use this with, but it can also be used with any other object based on object3d such as a group, mesh, or camera.

I am making use of the [user data object](/2021/02/16/threejs-userdata/) of the object3d class as a way to park what the original values where for the position and orientation of the object that was passed to it. When the active flag is false the values park there will be used to set the position and orientation of the object, else a set of values in the shake object will be used that can bu updated with a roll method.

```js
(function (api) {
 
    // degree to radian
    var deg = function (deg) {
        return Math.PI / 180 * deg;
    };
    // random pos value for an axis
    var rndPos = function (state) {
        var min = state.pos * -1,
        max = state.pos * 2;
        return min + max * Math.random();
    };
    // random pos value for an axis
    var rndDeg = function (state) {
        var min = deg(state.deg * -1),
        max = deg(state.deg * 2);
        return min + max * Math.random();
    };
 
    // create
    api.create = function (opt) {
        opt = opt || {};
        var shake = {
            pos: opt.pos === undefined ? 0.5 : opt.pos,
            deg: opt.deg === undefined ? 2.25 : opt.deg,
            euler: new THREE.Euler(0, 0, 0),
            vector: new THREE.Vector3(0, 0, 0),
            active: opt.active || false
        };
        return shake;
    };
 
    // just make a roll
    api.roll = function (shake) {
        shake.euler.x = rndDeg(shake);
        shake.euler.y = rndDeg(shake);
        shake.euler.z = rndDeg(shake);
        shake.vector.x = rndPos(shake);
        shake.vector.y = rndPos(shake);
        shake.vector.z = rndPos(shake);
    };
 
    // apply a new shake to object3d
    api.applyToObject3d = function (shake, obj3d) {
        // save home data
        if (!obj3d.userData.shakeData) {
            obj3d.userData.shakeData = {
                homeVector: new THREE.Vector3().copy(obj3d.position),
                homeEuler: new THREE.Euler().copy(obj3d.rotation)
            };
        }
        // if shake is active
        if (shake.active) {
            // copy shake.euler, and shake.vector to object
            obj3d.rotation.copy(shake.euler);
            obj3d.position.copy(shake.vector);
        } else {
            var sd = obj3d.userData.shakeData;
            obj3d.rotation.copy(sd.homeEuler);
            obj3d.position.copy(sd.homeVector);
        }
    }
 
}
    (this['ShakeMod'] = {}));
```

There might be many more features I might want to add to something like this, and also maybe change the whole way that I go about creating the shake values to begin with even. However for the sake of this post, and also for the example itself maybe it would be best to try to keep this module relative simple and not go to far beyond what I all ready have here. Also much of the logic that comes to mind when it comes to setting the active flag and updating the roll, and setting the values for position and rotation range values will change a little from one use case to another anyway. So then maybe much more of what comes to mind should not be baked into the module, but just be additional logic in the demo that will be using this module.

## 3 - Base demo of the shake module where I am shaking the whole scene

Now that I have my shake module together I am going to want a little more javaScript code that will serve as a way to test this module out. Much of this example is just more of the same when it comes to any other simple three.js code example, of full blown project in which I create a scene, one or more mesh objects, a camera, and a renderer. However one important thing to note is that if I want to use the shake with the scene object like I am doing in this example then I am going to want to not add the camera to the scene.

```js
(function () {
    // scene and grid helper
    var scene = new THREE.Scene();
    var gridHelper = new THREE.GridHelper(5, 5);
    scene.add(gridHelper);
    // box is a MESH base off of OBJECT3D
    var box = new THREE.Mesh(
            new THREE.BoxGeometry(1, 1, 1),
            new THREE.MeshNormalMaterial());
    box.position.set(0, 0.5, 0);
    scene.add(box);
    // camera DO NOT ADD TO SCENE
    var camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(45, 4 / 3, .5, 100);
    camera.position.set(5, 5, 5);
    camera.lookAt(0, 0, 0);
    // render
    var renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer();
    renderer.setSize(640, 480);
    document.getElementById('demo').appendChild(renderer.domElement);
 
    // state object
    var canvas = renderer.domElement;
    var state = {
        frame: 0,
        maxFrame: 3000,
        fps: 30,
        lt: new Date(),
        shake: ShakeMod.create({
            deg: 5.25,
            pos: 0.1,
            active: false
        })
    };
 
    // events
    var pointerDown = function () {
        state.shake.active = true;
    };
    var pointerUp = function () {
        state.shake.active = false;
    };
    var pointerMove = function (shake, canvas) {
        return function (e) {
            e.preventDefault();
            var canvas = e.target,
            box = canvas.getBoundingClientRect(),
            x = e.clientX - box.left,
            y = e.clientY - box.top;
            if (e.changedTouches) {
                x = e.changedTouches[0].clientX - box.left;
                y = e.changedTouches[0].clientY - box.top;
            };
            // Adjust pos and deg based on pointer position
            shake.pos = x / canvas.width * 0.95;
            shake.deg = y / canvas.height * 18;
        };
    };
    // mouse
    renderer.domElement.addEventListener('mousedown', pointerDown);
    renderer.domElement.addEventListener('mousemove', pointerMove(state.shake, canvas));
    renderer.domElement.addEventListener('mouseup', pointerUp);
    renderer.domElement.addEventListener('mouseout', pointerUp);
    // touch
    renderer.domElement.addEventListener('touchstart', pointerDown);
    renderer.domElement.addEventListener('touchmove', pointerMove(state.shake, canvas));
    renderer.domElement.addEventListener('touchend', pointerUp);
    renderer.domElement.addEventListener('touchcancel', pointerUp);
 
    // update
    var update = function (state, secs) {
        if (state.shake.active) {
            //state.shake.pos = 0.05 + 1.9 * state.bias;
            //state.shake.deg = 0.50 + 18 * state.bias;
            ShakeMod.roll(state.shake);
        } else {
            state.frame = 0;
        }
        //ShakeMod.update(state.shake, secs);
        ShakeMod.applyToObject3d(state.shake, scene);
    };
 
    // loop
    var loop = function () {
        state.per = state.frame / state.maxFrame;
        state.bias = 1 - Math.abs(state.per - 0.5) / 0.5;
        var now = new Date();
        secs = (now - state.lt) / 1000;
        requestAnimationFrame(loop);
        if (secs > 1 / state.fps) {
            update(state, secs);
            renderer.render(scene, camera);
            state.frame += state.fps * secs;
            state.frame %= state.maxFrame;
            state.lt = now;
        }
    };
    loop();
}
    ());
```

For this demo of the shake module I am using events as a way to adjust the shake pos and deg properties based on the position of a touch move or mouse move event on the canvas element. It is tempting to pull some of this into the module, but I think that this sort of thing will end up changing a little from one use case example to the next actually.

## 4 - Conclusion

This turned out to be a quick fun little example of using three.js as a way to create a scene shake module, that can also be used to shake other objects in a three.js environment. When it comes to suing this in projects in which I end up adding the camera to the scene then of course I am not going to want to make the scene object the object to which the shake applies then as the camera will then be relative to the scene object and things will not end up shaking. That kind of problem is easily fixed though by just wrapping everything that I want to shake into a group and then make that group the object that I use with my public method that apples the shake object to a three.js object based off of object 3d.
