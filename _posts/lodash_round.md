So today for yet another on eof my posts on [lodash](https://lodash.com/) and corresponding topics I have come around to writing a quick post on the [\_.round](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.10#round) method that can be used in a simular way to that of Math.round, bit with just one little additional feature that I just which the native methods had but does not. Also in this post I will be writing about some related topics that have to do with formating numbers, a common use case example that involves rounding.

## 1 - what to know before hand

this is a post on the lodash method /_.round that can be used to round numbers in the same way as that of Math.round in native javaScript, but can also be used to round to a given precision as well. In this post I also expand into, and touch base on other relevant topics as well with respect to padding, and formating of numbers. This is not a getting started post on lodash, or javaScript in general and I assume you have at least a little background in these subjects.
