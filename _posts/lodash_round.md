So today for yet another on eof my posts on [lodash](https://lodash.com/) and corresponding topics I have come around to writing a quick post on the [\_.round](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.10#round) method that can be used in a simular way to that of Math.round, bit with just one little additional feature that I just which the native methods had but does not. Also in this post I will be writing about some related topics that have to do with formating numbers, a common use case example that involves rounding.
