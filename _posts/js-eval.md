In javaScript and many other programing languages there is the [eval function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eval) that can be used to execute a string representation of some javaScript code. The eval function is a way to interpret javaScript from within javaScript itself. This will be a quick post on the js [eval function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/eval).
