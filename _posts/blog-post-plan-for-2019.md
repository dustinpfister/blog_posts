I have been writing blog posts for a while now on this site, and every now and then I think about what I should be doing when it comes to my writing process. I have a few posts that are doing well, and a whole bunch that are not so there is a need to improve my strategy. In addition it is the begging of a new year, so all the more reason to take a moment to consider what I am doing, and more importantly what I can do to improve. So I thought I would start a new year with a new post on a topic that I do not touch on often here when it comes to the subject of bogging in general, rather than javaScript related content.

## 1 - Blog posts should target a keyword

I am not promoting my content on social media, my strategy of blog post promotion is then depending completely on organic traffic. This has been the case sense the beginning, and so far it is working out okay. The thing about it though is that when I was first starting out, I was following a strategy that is like throwing a plate of spaghetti against a wall to see what sticks. Although that kind of strategy works, it is not very efficient. It is better to just know what will stick to begin with before I even start writing.

So at present I have a few posts that are preforming very well, and a whole lot that are not doing much of anything. To get my site to preform better I am just going to have to do gain a decent grasp on how to do keyword research effectively.
