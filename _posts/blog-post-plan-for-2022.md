I have got into the habit of always starting off a new year with a single post for a collection of posts that have to do with the topic of writing a blog rather than javaScript, or a given framework, or various tech related topic. Not that I think that this is the sort of thing that should happen only once a year, in fact I am always thinking in terms of what it is that I can and should do differently, and not just with this blog.

When I [look back at some of my older posts](/categories/blog/) for the various years in which I have write these kinds of posts I have to admit that often I do not follow threw with much of what I outline in such a post. So maybe this time I will write about what the plan is currently at least rather than what it is the I aim to do. The fact of the mater is that much might change this coming year when it comes to where it is that I choose to place my time and energy. This might mean less writing, but more work on actual projects. It might mean more writing but in the form of improving the quality of older content that I have all ready wrote rather than writing new posts.

## 1 - The plan for new content is to continue to focus more so on quality rather than quantity

Last year I was not aiming to change the frequency at which I was writing new posts, but that is what has happened. I was writing about one post every other day, but I have found that doing so just reduces quality of content to a point at which I am writing content that is just not adding much in terms of value. I still think that it is best to think in terms of quantity rather than quality when first starting out, but once one gains a sense of what works well, and what does not, it is time to shift gears with this.

So then I made the decision to just write between one and two new posts per week. This allows for me to start writing new posts that are a little longer to begin with, rather than getting them to that point at some point in the near or distant future when it comes to editing. This is then more in tune with the idea of writing higher quality posts, but at a lower frequency rather than the other way around.

### 1.1 - The usual frequency will then just be one or two new posts per week

I will then just be thinking in write just one new post, maybe two each week, at least if nothing happens that might change that anyway. This is what has been happening as of late anyway, and the main reason why is because the bulk of the writing that I have been doing is expanding older posts that I have written. Looking back a lot of them are in very poor shape, in terms of the language, and I have found often with respect to the source code examples as well.

### 1.2 - Frequency might increase with any new categories

If I start writing about a whole new category then of course the rate at which I will write new posts will increase back to the usual frequency, maybe even more so depending how much time I have to work with and what else is going on. If I am writing about a whole new category of content I typically want to get to that first twenty or so posts right away, and doing so often costs me a little in terms of quality a little to do so. There is always getting back to the various posts later at some point when it comes to editing, and also if it is something very new to me I may only have so much to write about it anyway until I log more time with it.

### 1.3 - at least a few new posts on lodash

I will be writing at least a [few new posts on lodash](/2019/02/15/lodash/), even though it is a framework that I think is slowly dieing out in terms of popularity. The main reason why is because this is just a category of content that is doing well for me in terms of traffic, so for that reason alone I have to. However there is additional motivation beyond that when it comes to many of the finer points revolving around lodash such as the topic of functional programing, using what is often called a [pony fill](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ponyfill) over that of [monkey patching](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Polyfill), and so forth.

## 2 - Editing older content

Although I might end up writing less in terms of new content this year, over all I might end up writing more this coming year. Not in the form of new posts, but in the form of greatly expanding content that I have all ready wrote before hand. The reason why I say that is because I have all ready wrote a whole lot of blog posts on interesting topics, but the current state of many of them might be only a few hundred words, but they could easily be expanded to thousands because there is just so much ground to cover with them actually.

### 2.1 - I all ready have some long form content posts, and this year I intend to expand more posts into long form posts

This kind of post might have many kinds of terms and words attached to them such as [long form content piece](https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/05/05/longform-content), or they [may use the word definitive in the title of the post](https://beabetterblogger.com/how-to-write-a-blog-post/). There are many different terms, and also standards as to what long form content is, and when it really comes down to it every bloger may very will have there own independent set of standards as to what constitutes a long form content post or not. However one crude yet effective way of going about doing so is to just have some kind of magic number in mind in terms of word count.

For me last year I stated a collection of todo lists that have to do with what I am planing out in terms of long form content in the form of lists for each category. Also in the main folder where I store these lists I took the time to write out a [readme file in which I am outlining what a long form content piece is for me](https://github.com/dustinpfister/blog_posts/tree/master/todo/edit-long-form). As of this writing I am thinking that a long form content piece should be at least around three thousand words, but that will of course change a little from one topic to another.

However one great thing about this kind of content is that there is the potential to write a post that can make just about every visitor happy with a given topic. One problem that I run into when writing a new post on javaScript is having to chose to write a post that is friendly to new javaScript developers, or write a post that is more in tune with where I am as a developer with well over ten years of experience thus far. With long from posts I can push the source code examples and corresponding written content that has to do with the very basics of something to the top of the post. When it comes to content in the form of additional, more advanced source code examples and topics that are more up to speed with where I am now, rater than where I was ten or more years ago, that kind of content can be later in the content piece.

Often when I go to read one of these kind of content pieces myself I will not always read the full post, but scan the headlines of each section, looking for something that is most relevant for what it is that I am looking for.

### 2.2 - Prioritizing by current traffic

Another general idea that I am exploring when it comes to outlining what to focus on next in terms of editing older content is by just looking into what content pieces are preforming the best in terms of traffic currently in terms of say clicks to the page from organic search over the last three months. At any given moment I have my top ten posts over all topics, there is also breaking things down on a per category level as with this sort of thing but thus far I am just starting out with my best preforming posts in general. So then I just take a look at what is going on in search console, and create a todo list of sorts based on the number of clicks that a post is getting and then just running now a list like that one by one to make sure that the quality of the content is decent. 

Just focusing on these kinds of posts alone is maybe not such a good idea, but neater is neglect, which is what I have been guilty of. So that is something that I think I would like to try to change this year, but getting together a better system fir making sure that I am dong at least a little touch up work with these posts, if not much more than that.

## 3 - Working out more with todo lists

One thing that I started last year is a folder in my main [blog posts Github Repository in which I store the markdown file source code for these blog posts that is a collection of todo lists](https://github.com/dustinpfister/blog_posts/tree/master/todo). I also did not just start doing this, and then later stop bothering with them, as of this writing I am still using these lists as a way to plan out what it is that I will be doing next. Not just in terms of new content, but also how it is that I should be prioritizing which posts deserve a greater amount of attention when it comes to editing. As such these todo lists can be used as a way to not just make general plans as I have in these blog posts, but also as a way to make sure that I follow threw with what I was planing out.

### 3.1 - Time centered todo lists

As of this writing I have worked out a number of standards for todo list, the ones that I have been using thus far have to do with general editing, long form content, and what to write about when it comes to new posts. However what really matters the most about these is that I am using them, which means that I can use them to get myself to follow threw with things. So then one idea for a new kind of list would be one that has to do with what I will be doing on a day by day basis, or a kind of time centered list.

So then the idea here is to just have a kind of time centered list that will act as a list of lists sort of speak. This way I can plan out what I will be doing on a day to day basis rather than not having much of a system and just making random choices as to what list I should be focusing on at any given moment.

Another great thing about this is that it will help me to figure out what is too much, or too little when it comes to the amount of work that I should be doing on a day to day basis. If I am biting off more than what I can chew I can just move certain times forward to the next day, or the day after that and so forth. If it seems like I am fining what I have planed out for a day to soon, then there is planing out more to do later, and getting a jump start on it.

## 4 - Conclusion

Although I am just writing one post on the topic of bloging about bloging per year, I am also thinking that this is maybe something that I should be doing a little more frequently that just that of once a year. The main reason why I say that is because I do not think that change, or revaluation of what one is doing with one self is something that should only happen once per year. Every day that I get up in the morning I am thinking about what it is that I could do differently.
