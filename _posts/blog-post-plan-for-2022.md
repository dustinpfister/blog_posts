I have got into the habit of always starting off a new year with a single post for a collection of posts that have to do with the topic of writing a blog rather than javaScript, or a given framework, or various tech related topic. Not that I think that this is the sort of thing that should happen only once a year, in fact I am always thinking in terms of what it is that I can and should do differently, and not just with this blog.

When I look back at some of my older posts for the various years in which I have write these kinds of posts I have to admit that often I do not follow threw with much of what I outline in such a post. So maybe this time I will write about what the plan is currently at least rather than what it is the I aim to do. The fact of the mater is that much might change this coming year when it comes to where it is that I choose to place my time and energy. This might mean less writing, but more work on actual projects. It might mean more writing but in the form of improving the quality of older content that I have all ready wrote rather than writing new posts.

## 1 - The plan for new content is to continue to focus more so on quality rather than quantity

Last year I was not aiming to change the frequency at which I was writing new posts, but that is what has happened. I was writing about one post every other day, but I have found that doing so just reduces quality of content to much for me. So then I made the decision to just write between one and two new posts per week. This allows for me to start writing new posts that are a little longer to begin with, rather than getting them to that point at some point in the near or distant future when it comes to editing. This is then more in tune with the idea of writing higher quality posts, but at a lower frequency rather than the other way around.

## 2 - Editing older content

Although I might end up writing less in terms of new content this year, over all I might end up writing more this coming year. Not in the form of new posts, but in the form of greatly expanding content that I have all ready wrote before hand. The reason why I say that is because I have all ready wrote a whole lot of blog posts on interesting topics, but the current state of many of them might be only a few hundred words, but they could easily be expanded to thousands because there is just so much ground to cover with them actually.

## 3 - Working out more todo lists

## 4 - Conclusion
