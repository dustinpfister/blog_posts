I have got into the habit of always starting off a new year with a single post for a collection of posts that have to do with the topic of writing a blog rather than javaScript, or a given framework, or various tech related topic. Not that I think that this is the sort of thing that should happen only once a year, in fact I am always thinking in terms of what it is that I can and should do differently, and not just with this blog.

When I look back at some of my older posts for the various years in which I have write these kinds of posts I have to admit that often I do not follow threw with much of what I outline in such a post. So maybe this time I will write about what the plan is currently at least rather than what it is the I aim to do. The fact of the mater is that much might change this coming year when it comes to where it is that I choose to place my time and energy. This might mean less writing, but more work on actual projects. It might mean more writing but in the form of improving the quality of older content that I have all ready wrote rather than writing new posts.
