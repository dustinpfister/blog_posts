My very first blog post was on hexo tags, and now and then I still write another post on hexo for what it is worth. I do still use the node.js powered static site generator know as hexo for building my site here at github pages, so it makes sense to write another post now and then when I change something at the least. Becuae my site has recently surpassed ten thousand monthly visitors it seems like it would be a good idea to add comments to this site. In this post I will be writing about the process of adding disqus comments to a hexo powered site.
