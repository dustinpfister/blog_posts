Time for yet another canvas example, this time I am thinking just a basic canvas grid example. A grid is something that will come up all the time when it comes to all kinds of canvas projects, mainly games, but other projects as well. When it comes to grids there is drawing them, and then there is having a model of sorts that contains the values of the grid. In this example I will be starting out with a very simple Grid class example, and a single drawing method that just draws the grid lines of an instance of that grid class.
