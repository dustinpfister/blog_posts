Today I think I will continue with my biplane modle in [threejs](https://threejs.org/) by making a model of models. That is to take the biplane module and make another modle that is just a group of these biplane modles. I do not thing I want to sink to much time into this, but it can still prove to be a little fun as a quick side project.
