When working on updating the theme for my site one of the many things I think about are my title tags. For many reasons they are one of the most important tags in an html document, not just from a search engine prespective, but also for the sake of informing visitors about what a page is about, or what is currently going on with a page. In this post I will be taking a momnent to play around a little with the document.title property in client side javaScript. This property can be used to both get and set the title text of an html document. There is also a little more to cover when it comes to going beyond the basics with this as well when it comes to using the title tag of a page to inform a user about somthing as well with javaScript so lets get to it.
