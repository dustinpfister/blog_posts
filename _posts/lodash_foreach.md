I have been writing about [lodash](https://lodash.com/) a lot these days, I feel that it is something that is still worth covering. It is true that many of the methods are now native in the late javaScript specs, but there are of course methods that are not. In addition it is true that many of the methods in lodash work a little differently then its native js counterpart, this appears to be the case with [\_.forEach](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.4#forEach) and the native [Array.prototype.ForEach](/2019/02/16/js-javascript-foreach/) method.

When it comes to the lodash forEach method and the native javaScript array prototype counterpart it seems that a lot of developers have this negative or positive attitude with the use of such methods. It is a pattern that I have observed in blog posts such as this and from discussions over and over again. My attitude with the use of lodash forEach or naive forEach is that the use of it is fine when it comes to quick code examples now and then. However it certainly goes without saying that it is not the only tool in the toolbox when it comes to looping over the contents of an array, or object in general for that matter. It is important to be ware of the other options in lodash, and in javaScript in general, and realize that sometimes it is best to go with some other option.

## 1 - lodash forEach

The lodash \_.forEach method is one of the many methods in lodash that is a collection method meaning it will work well with just about any object that is a collection of key value pairs in general, not just keys that are numbered and an instance of the javaScript array constructor.

### 1.1 - basic example of lodash for each method

The main difference that comes to mind is that I can define a condition that causes the looping of the array to stop.

```js
let _ = require('lodash');
 // lodash _.forEach
 _.forEach(['a','b','c'], function(el,index,arr){
    console.log(index + ' : ' +el + ' : ' + arr);
    if(el === 'b'){
        return false;
    }
 });
 // 0 : a : a,b,c
 // 1 : b : a,b,c
```

One of the main reasons why I choose to use a loop of some kind over Array.forEach is to have the ability to use the break, and continue keywords to cause looping to come to and end. However with the foreach method in lodash, I can return false in the body of the function I pass to it to break at least.

### 1.2 - Lodash for each is a collection method

```js
let a = {
    foo: 'a',
    bar: 'b',
    baz: 'c'
};
_.forEach(a, function(el,index,arr){
    console.log(index + ' : ' + el);
});
//foo: a
//bar: b
//baz: c
```

## 2 - Vanilla JavaScript alternatives to lodash for each


Just like with Array.forEach it some times makes sense to just use a loop of some kind. This allows for full control with respect to use of defining conditions with break, and continue, as well as complex conditions for starting, continuing, stepping, and additional escape conditions. There is also the matter that in some cases a loop is faster, but most of the time it does not make much of a difference, and I often view it as a nano pick issue.

### 2.1 - Basic native array for each method example

```js
// native Array.forEach
['a','b','c'].forEach(function(el,index,arr){
    console.log(index + ' : ' +el + ' : ' + arr);
    if(el === 'b'){
        return false; // does nothing to stop it
    }
});
 // 0 : a : a,b,c
 // 1 : b : a,b,c
 // 2 : c : a,b,c
```

## 3 - Conclusion

Hopefully this post answered a certain question many javaScript developers may have these days, which is the question of the relevance of lodash today. I would say yes, but I can also understand the alternative mindset with this as well.
