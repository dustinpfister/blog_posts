The [git diff](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-diff) command is useful for finding changes between two commits when using git for source control. there are many options for formatting the output also, so for one example say I am just interesting in getting a list of files that have changed from a given starting and ending commit it, such a task can be completed by using the git diff command with the name only option.

I am also a javaScript developer so this post will also be on a few quick examples that make use of the child process module in core nodejs to make git command calls that help get a list of files that have changed between tow commits in a repository. However I will be going over some examples that can just be used in the command line interface also of course.
