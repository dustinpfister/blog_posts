The [git diff](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-diff) command is useful for finding changes between two commits when using git for source control. there are many options for formatting the output also, so for one example say I am just interesting in getting a list of files that have changed from a given starting and ending commit it, such a task can be compleated by using the git diff command with the name only option.
