When it comes to [threejs](https://threejs.org/) maybe there is still a great deal more for me to learn about the framework itself. However for now I would like to make at least a few examples of what can be done with three.js when it comes to making some kind of actual project.

There is the prim and proper way of going about creating a 3d model of something, and that is all fine and good. However it also strikes me as something that would end up eading up a lot of time. So there is also the not so prim and proper way to go about creating a 3d modle of something. It is the later that I will be going over today by making a simple crude yet effective 3d model of a Biplane.
