When it comes to [threejs](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#manual/en/introduction/Creating-a-scene) maybe there is still a great deal more for me to learn about the framework itself, however for now I would like to make at least a [few examples](/2021/02/19/threejs-examples/) of what can be done with three.js when it comes to making some kind of actual project. 

With that said there is the prim and proper way of going about creating a 3d model of something, and that is all fine and good, but it also strikes me as something that would end up eating up a lot of time. So there is also the not so prim and proper way to go about creating a 3d model of something. It is the later that I will be going over today by making a simple crude yet effective 3d model of a [Biplane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biplane) using just the built in three.js geometry constructors mainly the [box geometry](/2021/04/26/threejs-box-geometry/) constructor and [groups](/2018/05/16/threejs-grouping-mesh-objects/).

This example will involve create a bunch of mesh objects, combining them into a group, and then positioning and skinning things to make something that looks like a little plane. It would then be fun to add a few more models to create a plane, and a main world object for a crude scene of some kind. For now I think I would like to have just one plane, and have it fly around in a circle, and move the camera around to have a nice neat looping animation.

## What to know first

This is a post on a full working three.js project example of a little looping animation of a simple biplane model made from mesh objects using the built in three.js geometry [constructor functions](/2019/02/27/js-javascript-constructor/). In this example I am also making use of a number of other features built into three.js such as groups. So this post is not intended for [developers that are still a little new to three.js](/2018/04/04/threejs-getting-started/), as I assume that you have at least covered some of the basics when it comes to using three.js and javaScript to create some kind of scene. So I will not be covering the very basic of three.js itself here, however I will be going over a few things that I think that you should have solid at this point before continuing to read this post.

### Version Numbers matter with three.js

When I first wrote this post I was using r125 of three.js and I have also been doing a fare about or editing of this post as i continue to refine this basic three.js model. The last time I edited this post then I was using three.js version r127. I have made a habit of mentioning what version numbers I am using in every three.js post that I write, and also make note of it as I edit older posts also. Code braking changes are made to three.js all the time, so I think doing so is called for.

### Source code up on Github

The source code that I have together for this [post thus far is up on Github](https://github.com/dustinpfister/test_threejs/tree/master/views/forpost/threejs-examples-biplane/).

## 1 - The biplane module

The idea here is to create a javaScript module that will create and return an instance of a [THREE.Group](/2018/05/16/threejs-grouping-mesh-objects/) which is just a way to pack a whole bunch of Mesh objects into a single group. An instance of THREE.Group like a Mesh object also inherits from the [Object3d class](/2018/04/23/threejs-object3d/), and as such also has a userData object which is the standard object that is to be used to place app specific data. Such as the current radian value for a prop on a biplane.

So then in this module I just have a bunch of helper methods that create and return mesh objects that are positioned and sized in a way in which when grouped together ends up looking like a biplane. It might be crude, but if I am okay with this kind of look and feel it will get the job done when it comes to a simplistic low poly art style.


```js
var Biplane = (function () {
 
    var materials = {
        plane: new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({
            color: 0x88afaf
        }),
        guy: new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({
            color: 0xffffff
        }),
        prop: new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({
            color: 0x404040
        })
    };
 
    var api = {};
 
    // create a wing
    var createWing = function(opt, y){
        var wing = new THREE.Mesh(
            new THREE.BoxGeometry(2,1,10),
            opt.materials.plane || materials.plane
        );
        wing.position.y = y;
        return wing;
    };
 
    // create a body
    var createBody = function(opt){
        var body = new THREE.Mesh(
            new THREE.BoxGeometry(10,2,2),
            opt.materials.plane || materials.plane
        );
        body.position.x = -2;
        return body;
    };
 
    // create a body
    var createTail = function(opt){
        var body = new THREE.Mesh(
            new THREE.BoxGeometry(1,2,2),
            opt.materials.plane || materials.plane
        );
        body.position.x = -6.5;
        body.position.y = 2;
        return body;
    };
 
    // create guy
    var createGuy = function(){
        var guy = new THREE.Mesh(
            new THREE.BoxGeometry(1,1,1),
            materials.guy
        );
        guy.position.x = -2;
        guy.position.y = 1.5;
        return guy;
    };
 
    // create prop
    var createProp = function(){
        var prop = new THREE.Mesh(
            new THREE.BoxGeometry(0.5,4,0.5),
            materials.prop
        );
        
        prop.position.x = 3.25;
        return prop;
    };
 
    // main create method
    api.create = function(opt){
        opt = opt || {};
        opt.materials = opt.materials || {};
 
        var plane = new THREE.Group();
        // body and tail
        plane.add(createBody(opt));
        plane.add(createTail(opt));
        // ref to prop
        plane.userData.prop = createProp();
        plane.add(plane.userData.prop);
        // wings
        plane.add(createWing(opt, -1));
        plane.add(createWing(opt, 1));
        // guy
        plane.add(createGuy());
        // prop radian to move prop
        plane.userData.propRadian = 0;
        plane.userData.propRPS = 0.25;
        return plane;
    };
 
    api.update = function(bi, per){
        var ud = bi.userData;
        ud.propRadian = Math.PI * 64 * per;
        ud.prop.rotation.set(ud.propRadian,0,0)
    };
 
    return api;
}
    ());
```

## 2 - An example making use of the biplane model so far

So then now it is just a question of having a main javaScript file where I am making use of this model directly or indirectly by way of another main world module of some kind. In this section I will be doing all the usual when it comes to making a threejs project such as creating a scene, camera, and renderer when it comes to the typical main javaScript file where I often do such things. However before I get to write about that file there are a bunch of additional modules that I would like to use with this biplane module of mine. I will want to have a module to create something that will serve as some ground, and it should have something to sever as a texture so that I know that the plane is moving around. In other worlds it would be nice to have something to serve as a frame of reference. Also I am sure that when it comes to using this biplane module I am going to use it in a way where I will be creating one or more instances of it in a main world module that will contain the ground, lights, and anything else I might want to add to the over all scene.

So then in this section I will be going over all the additional files that I am using to do something interesting with this biplane module.

### 2.1 - A utils module

I have a general utility module for this example that I am using in the main world module, and any additional areas in the over all example. Here in this module I have a get per values method that will create and return a collection of values that I use to update the position and rotation of objects by a frame over max frame values.

```js
var utils = {};
 
utils.pi2 = Math.PI * 2;
 
utils.getPerValues = function (frame, maxFrame, base) {
    frame = frame === undefined ? 0 : frame;
    maxFrame = maxFrame === undefined ? 100 : maxFrame;
    base = base || 2;
    var per = frame / maxFrame,
    bias = 1 - Math.abs(per - 0.5) / 0.5;
    return {
        frame: frame,
        maxFrame: maxFrame,
        fps: 30,
        per: per,
        bias: bias,
        base: base,
        biasLog: Math.log(1 + bias * (base - 1)) / Math.log(base)
    };
};
 
// mathematical modulo
utils.mod = function (x, m) {
    return (x % m + m) % m;
};
 
utils.normalizeRadian = function (radian) {
    return utils.mod(radian, utils.pi2);
};
```

### 2.2 - a Tile Index module

This is a tile index module that I borrowed from [my post on the plane geometry constructor](/2019/06/05/threejs-plane/). This tile index module is a nice little module that I can use to quickly create a plane geometry with a checkered texture. As you might suspect I will be using this module to create a geometry and mesh that will serve as the ground of this little animation loop example of this biplane.

```js
(function (api) {
 
    var MATERIALS = [
        new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({
            color: 0xffffff,
            emissive: 0x00ff00,
            emissiveIntensity: 0.75,
            side: THREE.DoubleSide
        }),
        new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({
            color: 0xaaaaaa,
            emissive: 0x00ff00,
            emissiveIntensity: 0.2,
            side: THREE.DoubleSide
        })
    ];
 
    var planeTileGeo = function (w, h, sw, sh) {
        w = w === undefined ? 16 : w;
        h = h === undefined ? 16 : h;
        sw = sw === undefined ? 8 : sw;
        sh = sh === undefined ? 8 : sh;
        var planeGeo = new THREE.PlaneGeometry(w, h, sw, sh),
        tileIndex = 0,
        len = sw * sh,
        mi,
        y,
        i;
        while (tileIndex < len) {
            i = tileIndex * 6;
            mi = 0;
            planeGeo.addGroup(i, 3, mi);
            planeGeo.addGroup(i + 3, 3, mi);
            tileIndex += 1;
        }
        return planeGeo;
    };
 
    // create and return a plane with tile groups
    api.create = function (opt) {
        opt = opt || {};
        opt.materials = opt.materials || MATERIALS;
        // add a plane
        var plane = new THREE.Mesh(
                planeTileGeo(opt.w, opt.h, opt.sw, opt.sh),
                opt.materials);
        plane.rotation.set(-Math.PI / 2, 0, 0);
        return plane;
    };
 
    // set checkerBoard material index values
    api.setCheckerBoard = function (plane) {
        var w = plane.geometry.parameters.widthSegments,
        h = plane.geometry.parameters.heightSegments,
        tileIndex = 0,
        gi,
        len = w * h,
        mi,
        y;
        while (tileIndex < len) {
            if (w % 2) {
                mi = tileIndex % 2;
            } else {
                y = Math.floor(tileIndex / w);
                mi = y % 2 ? 1 - tileIndex % 2 : tileIndex % 2
            }
            gi = tileIndex * 2;
            plane.geometry.groups[gi].materialIndex = mi;
            plane.geometry.groups[gi + 1].materialIndex = mi;
            tileIndex += 1;
        }
    };
 
    // set checkerBoard material index values
    api.setBoxBoard = function (plane) {
        var w = plane.geometry.parameters.widthSegments,
        h = plane.geometry.parameters.heightSegments,
        tileIndex = 0,
        len = w * h,
        gi,
        mi,
        x,
        y;
        while (tileIndex < len) {
            x = tileIndex % w;
            y = Math.floor(tileIndex / w);
            mi = 0;
            if (y > 0 && y < h - 1) {
                if (x > 0 && x < w - 1) {
                    mi = 1;
                }
            }
            gi = tileIndex * 2;
            plane.geometry.groups[gi].materialIndex = mi;
            plane.geometry.groups[gi + 1].materialIndex = mi;
            tileIndex += 1;
        }
    };
 
}
    (this['TileMod'] = {}));
```

### 2.3 - A world module

I will then want a main world module that will be used to wrap everything together. So then this is a situation in which I have a main world group object and then a whole bunch more objects that helper to create an over all world to look at beyond just that of the little biplane model.

```js
(function (api) {
    // create world
    api.create = function () {
        var world = new THREE.Group();
        // CREATING A BIPLANE and adding it to the world
        var bp = world.userData.bp = Biplane.create();
        world.add(bp);
        // Camera
        var camera = world.userData.camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(45, 4 / 3, 0.5, 150);
        camera.position.set(-15, 10, 0);
        bp.add(camera);
        // ground
        var ground = TileMod.create({
                w: 100,
                h: 100
            });
        ground.position.set(0, -5, 0);
        TileMod.setCheckerBoard(ground);
        world.add(ground);
        // point light
        var pointLight = new THREE.PointLight(0xffffff, 1);
        pointLight.position.set(28, 20, 40);
        pointLight.add(new THREE.Mesh(
                new THREE.SphereGeometry(0, 100, 10),
                new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({
                    color: 'white'
                })));
        world.add(pointLight);
        // ambient light
        //world.add(new THREE.AmbientLight(0xffffff, 0.00))
        // return world group
        return world;
    };
    // update world
    api.update = function (world, frame, maxFrame) {
        var wud = world.userData;
        wud.perObj = utils.getPerValues(frame, maxFrame);
        // biplane
        Biplane.update(wud.bp, wud.perObj.per);
        var radian1 = utils.normalizeRadian(utils.pi2 * wud.perObj.per),
        radian2 = utils.normalizeRadian(radian1 + Math.PI / 180 * 1 + Math.PI * 1.5);
        wud.bp.position.set(
            Math.cos(radian1) * 30,
            5,
            Math.sin(radian1) * 30);
        wud.bp.lookAt(new THREE.Vector3(
                Math.cos(radian2) * 10,
                0,
                Math.sin(radian2) * 10));
        // camera
        wud.camera.position.set(-20, 10, -20 + 40 * wud.perObj.biasLog);
        wud.camera.lookAt(wud.bp.position);
    };
}
    (this['worldMod'] = {}));
```

### 2.4 - The main JavaScript file

Now I just need a little additional javaScript code to make use of the main world module and everythjng that it is built on top of, including of course the biplane module.

```js
(function () {
    // Scene
    var scene = new THREE.Scene();
    scene.background = new THREE.Color('cyan');
    // create state
    var state = {
        lt: new Date(),
        fps: 30,
        frame: 0,
        maxFrame: 600,
        world: worldMod.create() // create the world
    };
    scene.add(state.world);
    // Render
    var renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer();
    renderer.setSize(640, 480);
    document.getElementById('demo').appendChild(renderer.domElement);
    // loop
    function loop() {
        var now = new Date(),
        secs = (now - state.lt) / 1000,
        wud = state.world.userData;
        requestAnimationFrame(loop);
        if (secs > 1 / state.fps) {
            worldMod.update(state.world, state.frame, state.maxFrame);
            renderer.render(scene, state.world.userData.camera);
            state.lt = now;
            state.frame += state.fps * secs;
            state.frame %= state.maxFrame;
        }
    };
    loop();
}
    ());
```

The result of all of this then is having two biplane models one is the default lime color, and the other I made red. The props spin at two different speeds, and that is just about it for now. the next step would be to create another project where I am making use of this model, and maybe a few more just like it to create some kind of scene.

## 3 - Conclusion

I like to make models this way, I can just slap something together and it just works. I am sure that in a real project I might run into problems sooner or later. However yet again maybe not if the final project is some kind of video rather than a game. What really matters is how things look, and this kind of very low poly look is kind of nice I think.

There are many additional little details that I might want to add at some point if I do get around to putting more time into this. I could maybe add some ways to move the guys head in the plane, and also skin the mesh with a face of some kind also while I am at it. There is also maybe adding some additional code that has to do with moving the mesh objects within the group. For example if I use this in a project where the plane can end up being destroyed I can have some kind of effect where the parts fly all over the place. However maybe getting into all of that would be a matter for another post.
