The [Linux df](http://linuxcommand.org/lc3_man_pages/df1.html) command is what I generaly use to find out how much space a folder takes up in the bash command line. By default with no argumnets it will give the amount of space availabule on all mounted file systems is given. It can also be given a mount point, or a path of a file to find out what the deal is when the amount of space that certin folders and files take up.
