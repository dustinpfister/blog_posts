In many phaser ce projects there will come a time where I will want to rotate a sprite from one angle to another. When doing so i will want to have the sprite rotate in a direction that is the shortest angular distance. Thankfully there is a Math Class method in phaser ce that is there for this very purpose called Phaser.Math.rotateToAngle, in this post i will be covering a quick example that makes use of this method.
