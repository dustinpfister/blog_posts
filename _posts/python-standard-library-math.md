Time to wrap up this first week of [learning python](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/) on my own, today I think I will be taking a look at one of the many standard librarys to work with in python starting with the [math library](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/math.html).

In javaScript there is the built in Math object that contains all kinds of useful properties and methods that help with working out all kinds of Math expressions. So when it comes to Python there should be another such Object, or built in module at least to work with and it would seem that there is. However things are a little broken up with some things, for example when it comes to absolute value there is a built in absolute value method in python itself, and there is another such method in the math module. Also when it comes to generating random numbers there is no such method to be found in the standard math module, instead there is yet another module called random that contains such a method. So depeding on what I need to do, it would be best to look at what there is to work with on built in functions first. Then if I might look at the math module, but even then there is more than one math module.

Anyway in todays post I am going to be looking at some of the methods that there are to work with whe it comes to the standard built in math libray in python. I will also be taking a look at some other features of python itself, and other librarys to work with in order to trutly get up and runinf with some math in python.
