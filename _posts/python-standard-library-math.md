Time to wrap up this first week of [learning python](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/) on my own, today I think I will be taking a look at one of the many standard librarys to work with in python starting with the [math library](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/math.html).

In javaScript there is the built in Math object that contains all kinds of useful properties and methods that help with working out all kinds of Math expressions. So when it comes to Python there should be another such Object, or built in module at least to work with and it would seem that there is. However things are a little broken up with some things, for example when it comes to absolute value there is a built in absolure value method in python itself, and there is another such method in the math module. So depeding on what I need to do, it would be best to look at what there is to work with on built in functions first.

Anyway in todays post I am going to be looking at some of the methods that there are to work with whe it comes to the standard built in math libray in python.
