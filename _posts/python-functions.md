I am still in the process of [learning python](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/), and one imporant aspect of learniong python, or any langauge for that matter, is to know how to define functions. Coming from a javaScript background I have a lot of concerns, such as if python supports high order functions or not \( the anwser is yes \). Still I need to start somewhere, snd that means just staring out with some basic python function examples, and then move on more complex topics such as high order functions.

## 1 - Basic Python function examples

First things first lets start out slow and just get a very basic function example.

```python
def hello(name):
    print('Hello ' + name)
 
hello('Sam') # 'Hello Sam'
hello('Paul') # 'Hello Paul'
```

## 2 - Setting a return value

## 3 - Function parameters

## 4 - default arguments for function parameters
