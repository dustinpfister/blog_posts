I am still in the process of [learning python](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/), and one imporant aspect of learniong python, or any langauge for that matter, is to know how to define functions. Coming from a javaScript background I have a lot of concerns, such as if python supports high order functions or not \( the anwser is yes \). Still I need to start somewhere, snd that means just staring out with some basic python function examples, and then move on more complex topics such as high order functions.
