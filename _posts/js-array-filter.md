So in native javaScript there are a number of prototype methods that can be used off of any instance of an array. One such method is the js array filter method than can be used to create a new array from an array with a whole bunch of elements filtered out. The logic that is used to filter out elements can be defined in the body of a function that is passed to the array filter method.

The js array filter method is just one of many methods that a javaScript developer should be aware of in the native array prototype, alone with many other such methods in other prototype objects. So the js array filter method is often used with or in replacement of other methods like array map, and array forEach.
