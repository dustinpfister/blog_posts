I have made a threejs example post way back in the day in which I make a simple, crude house model using only javaScript code on top of threejs itself. I do like to make thouse kinds of models as I can pack everything into a blog post, not just in terms of the javaScript code, but also the data that composes the various buffer geometry attribites as well. However when it comes to starting to work on some kind of real project with threejs, this is just not generaly how things are done for the most part. Do not get my wrong though, some times it seems like the best way to do what I want to do will involve a whole lot of javaScript code to create geometry. However some times it seems like the best way forward is to create some kind of asset in a program like blender and then export from that programe into a file format like that of the DAE file format. So in this threejs project example post, I am going to be wrtiign about a new kind of house model where I am using an extreial file as a way to have the geometry for the house model.
