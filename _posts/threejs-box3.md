The box3 class in the javaScript library known as threejs is a way to create a box in the from of a min and max instance of the Vector3 class. This Box can then be used for things like getting another vector3 instance that is the size of the box. There is creating a new instance of the box3 class and then using that as a way to preform some kind of an action on an object such as scaling that object to the size of the instance of the box3 class.
