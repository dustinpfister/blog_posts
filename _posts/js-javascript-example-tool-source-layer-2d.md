For a final new [javaScript example](/2021/04/02/js-javascript-example/) for this month at least I made what might prove to be the first of several tool type project examples. What I mean by this is that I might often want to create some kind of project where the aim is to create some kind of resource such as a sprite sheet, world map, or maybe just some kind of image asset actually. I do not care so take the time to create a full blown image editor from the ground up mind you when it comes to that I have come to enjoy just using GIMP and moving on with my life. However often it might make sense to create some kind of custom image editor where I can open up a image file that I do not want to use directly as part of the image project, but to just serve as a source for a drawing that I will create in another canvas layer on top of this source layer.
