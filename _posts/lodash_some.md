The [lodash \_.some](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.11#some) collection method can be used to test to see if just one element of an array, or key of an object in general meets a given condition. There is another collection method known as \_.every that works in a similar way to that of the \_.some method but will only return true when all elements of a collection meet a given condition. In this post I will be going over some simple examples of both, as well as some ways of doing so with just plain old vanilla js as well.
