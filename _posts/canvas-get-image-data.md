So when it comes to working with canvas there is the [get image data](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/getImageData) method that can be used to get image data from a canvas. In addition there is also the [put image data](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/putImageData) method as well that can be used to put that data into a canvas, and there is also the [ImageData](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ImageData/ImageData) constructor that can be used to create an instance of image data from scratch.
