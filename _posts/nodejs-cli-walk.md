So for todays node cli tool example I will be writing about a basic file system walker that I have put together for this series of posts. I have wrote a few posts on file system walkers such as klaw, and just simply walk, as well as the many native nodejs module methods that can be used to make a file system walker from the ground up. This is a post on making node cli tools so for todays post I will be making a file system walker using the node file system method like readdir, stat, and so forth.
