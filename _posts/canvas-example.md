I have got into the habit of making a bunch of [canvas examples](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial), and writing posts on these canvas examples. It then seems like a good idea to have a post that will serve as a main index post of sorts for all of these posts. The canvas examples I have made range form simple animations, to more complex game and simulation prototypes. This post then serves as an over all effort to make this collection of content more organized.

## 1 - Animation basics canvas example

In my [animations basics canvas example](/2019/10/10/canvas-example-animation-basics/) I touched base on the basics of animation and canvas elements as I currently have come to understand it. Animation can be a powerful tool, as it is not always about making things that are artful, but practical as well. For example if you are trying to wok out some kind of problem it some times make sense to visualize that problem.

## 2 - Animation and fractals

I have some interest in fractals, and thus far I have this one post that I have worked out where I am making a basic fractal and displaying a fractal like animation with canvas elements.
