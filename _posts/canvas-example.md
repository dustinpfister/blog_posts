I have got into the habit of making a bunch of [canvas examples](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial), and writing posts on these canvas examples. It then seems like a good idea to have a post that will serve as a main index post of sorts for all of these posts. The canvas examples I have made range form simple animations, to more complex game and simulation prototypes. This post then serves as an over all effort to make this collection of content more organized.

## 1 - Animation basics canvas example

In my [animations basics canvas example](/2019/10/10/canvas-example-animation-basics/) I touched base on the basics of animation and canvas elements as I currently have come to understand it. Animation can be a powerful tool, as it is not always about making things that are artful, but practical as well. For example if you are trying to wok out some kind of problem it some times make sense to visualize that problem.

## 2 - Animation and fractals

I have some interest in fractals, and thus far I have this [one post that I have worked out where I am making a basic fractal](/2020/02/19/canvas-example-animation-fractal/) and displaying a fractal like animation with canvas elements.

## 3 - A simple ball bound canvas example

In this [example I have just a simple bounding ball](/2020/01/14/canvas-example-ball-bounce/), a typical example that just about any javaScript developer will end up getting to at some point or another. getting to working on this kind of example is a good way to become familiar with certain things that are common with many javaScript projects such as collision detection, and how to go about setting or change the angles or directions of things when they hit a surface.

## 4 - A Basic idle game

In this post I made a very [basic idle game prototype](/2020/02/01/canvas-example-basic-idle-game/). 

## 5 - A button layout module

One thing that comes up often with canvas projects is how to go about adding buttons. A quick and simple way is to just use html input tags, however often it might be more desirable to have some area in the canvas element that acts as a button. So I have a [post in which I work out a module that helps with the process of adding buttons to a canvas project](/2020/02/03/canvas-example-button-layout/).

## 6 - A basic clock canvas example

Making [a clock with canvas](/2019/12/13/canvas-example-clock-basic/) can be fun. I find them simple to make, and there is so much that can be done that is centered around time.

## 7 - Making a breakout game clone

I thought it would be a good idea to start yet another [breakout clone](/2020/02/13/canvas-example-game-breakout/). This is one of many ideas of a kind of project that has been all ready done to death, but there still may be a great deal of potential for adding a unique spin to it.

## 8 - A cannon shoot game canvas example

There are many games that have came and went ever the years that can be described as a kind of [cannon shoot](/2020/02/17/canvas-example-game-cannon-shoot/) type game.
