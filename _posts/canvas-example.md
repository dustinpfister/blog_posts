I have got into the habit of making a bunch of [canvas examples](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial), and writing posts on these canvas examples. It then seems like a good idea to have a post that will serve as a main index post of sorts for all of these posts. The canvas examples I have made range form simple animations, to more complex game and simulation prototypes. This post then serves as an over all effort to make this collection of content more organized.
