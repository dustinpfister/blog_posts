The javaScript not operator can be used to negate a value and turn the value into a boolean value. The operator can come in handy when writing many expressions that might come up when working with conditional statements, and also with feature testing. In some code examples I see it being used to trim down the size of a boolean literal expression, and I am sure that there are many other use examples for the [js not](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Logical_Operators) operator.

console.log(bool); // true
