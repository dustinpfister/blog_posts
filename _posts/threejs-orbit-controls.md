It would not be to hard to implement some camera controls for a [three.js](https://threejs.org/) project from scratch, it would just involve some [event handlers](/2019/01/16/js-event-listeners/) that would be used to set the [position](/2022/04/04/threejs-object3d-position/) and [rotation](/2022/04/08/threejs-object3d-rotation/) of the camera using some [Object3D](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/core/Object3D) class methods maybe. 

However there is some additional resources in the three.js project repository itself that can be used to quickly set some orbit controls in a flash which can be found in the examples folder of the repository. In this post I will be covering how to quickly set up some orbit controls for the camera, so you do not have to keep changing hard coded values, or spend a great deal of time working on your own solution to just look around a scene.

The Orbit Controls solution that can be found in the three.js examples folder in the github repo of the project can be used to quickly set up a solution for panning, zooming, and changing the orientation of a camera with the mouse, keyboard, and touch events. So then these source code examples will need threejs, as well as OrbitControls.js on top of the additional code that I am going over in this post.

## Orbit controls in threejs and what to know before hand

This is an advanced post on one of the many useful time saving features that are found in the three.js examples folder in the [three.js github repository](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/r125). If you are looking for my take on [getting started with three.js](/2018/04/04/threejs-getting-started/) I have wrote a post on that topic before, and what I am writing about here is just a few steps beyond that. So in this post I assume you have a basic working knowledge of javaScript, and three.js and are wondering if there is some kind of official solution for quickly adding some orbit controls to a three.js project, in which case you are at the right place. Still in this section I will be going over a few pointers to know before continuing with the rest of the post.

### The source code examples here are on github

The source code examples here that make use of threejs, and OrbitControls.js can be found in my [test threejs repository](https://github.com/dustinpfister/test_threejs/tree/master/views/forpost/threejs-orbit-controls). If you see anything wrong with the code that would be where to make a pull request, there is also the comments section of this blog post that can be used to bring something up.

### Where to get the file for orbit controls

In order to quickly add Orbit controls you need to add a \*.js file that is in the three.js repository that can be found [here](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/r125/examples/js/controls/OrbitControls.js). You will want to add this file to your project in a way so that it will append three.js, and add a constructor called [THREE.OrbitControls](https://threejs.org/docs/#examples/controls/OrbitControls).

### Version Numbers Matter, and code breaking changes

Yes version numbers matter when working with three.js. When I first wrote this post I was working with r91, and as of this writing when I took a moment to edit this post last I was using r127. Sense then some code breaking changes have happened so be aware of what version of threejs you are using. The main change that I have noticed sense r91 is that it is now required to give a dom element reference as the second argument when calling the main orbit controls constructor function. I will still keep the old r91 examples in this post just for the hell of it as many of the features still seem to work more or less the same way when the few required changes are made.

## 1 - Using the OrbitControls constructor

If you all ready know how to create a basic scene in threejs, and you have a proper copy of the orbit controls added to the page along with the corresponding version of threejs, then adding orbit controls is not all that hard. The THREE.OrbitControls constructor just needs to be called passing a camera that the orbit controls will be controlling as the first argument. On top of the camera a dom element reference might also have to be added if you are using a later version of three.js \( at least r125 forward as of this writing \)

### 1.1 - Example of the OrbitControls constructor (r127)

When using the orbit controls constructor in r125 I now need to pass a camera as the first argument like before, but now I also need to pass a dom element reference as the second argument. Once you have an instance of the controls you just need to call the update method of the controls in a render or update loop.


```js
(function () {
 
    // Scene
    var scene = new THREE.Scene();
    scene.background = new THREE.Color('blue');
 
    // Camera
    var camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(45, 4 / 3, 1.4, 2.8);
    camera.position.set(1.3, 1.5, 1.3);
    camera.lookAt(0, 0, 0);
 
    // Something to look at
    scene.add(new THREE.Mesh(
            new THREE.BoxGeometry(1, 1, 1),
            new THREE.MeshDepthMaterial()));
 
    // Render
    var renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer();
    renderer.setSize(640, 480);
    document.getElementById('demo').appendChild(renderer.domElement);
 
    // Orbit Controls The DOM element must now be given as a second argument
    var controls = new THREE.OrbitControls(camera, renderer.domElement);
 
    // loop
    var loop = function () {
        requestAnimationFrame(loop);
        // UPDATE CONTROLS
        controls.update();
        renderer.render(scene, camera);
    };
 
    loop();
 
}
    ());
```

### 1.2 - Old example of the OrbitControls constructor (r91)

When I first wrote this post I was using r91. With that version of threejs I just need to call the constructor passing the instance of the camera I want to to control which will give me an instance of THREE.OrbitControls. However in late versions of threejs this might cause an error.

```js
// CAMERA
var camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(75, 320 / 240, 1, 1000);
camera.position.set(250, 200, 250);
camera.lookAt(0, 0, 0);
 
// add controls for the camera
var controls = new THREE.OrbitControls(camera);
```

## 2 - Basic example of Orbit controls (r125)

I just need to call the THREE.OrbitControls constructor and pass a camera as the first argument, and then a dom element as the second argument. The dom element can be the dome element that is used in a renderer such as the built in web gl renderer.

```js
(function () {
 
    // Scene
    var scene = new THREE.Scene();
 
    // Camera
    var camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(45, 4 / 3, .5, 100);
    camera.position.set(2, 2, 2);
    camera.lookAt(0, 0, 0);
 
    // Something to look at
    scene.add(new THREE.Mesh(
            new THREE.BoxGeometry(1, 1, 1),
            new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({
                color: 0xff0000,
                wireframe: true
            })));
 
    // Render
    var renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer();
    renderer.setSize(320, 240);
    document.getElementById('demo').appendChild(renderer.domElement);
 
    // Orbit Controls The DOM element must now be given as a second argument
    var controls = new THREE.OrbitControls(camera, renderer.domElement);
 
    // loop
    function animate() {
        requestAnimationFrame(animate);
        controls.update();
        renderer.render(scene, camera);
    };
 
    animate();
 
}
    ());
```

So this new example is more or less the same as the old r91 example. It would seem that the only change is that I now have to give that dome element reference.

## 3 - Full working Example of three.js Orbit Controls (r91)

For a full working example of this I will of course want something to look at such as a cube, and of course I will want the usual scene, camera, and renderer. In my html not only will I want to load three.js like normal, I will want to see to it that the Orbit controls are added to three.js, as or r91 they are not part of three.js itself, so it must be added by some means.

### 3.1 - The html (r91)

I just need to like to threejs, the orbit controls, and then the main.js file that contains the rest of the javaScript code. I also have a single div element that will serve as a mount point for this.

```html
<html>
    <head>
        <title>test_threejs demos</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div id="demo"></div>
 
        <!-- Three.js, and orbit controls -->
        <script src="/js/threejs/0.91.0/three.min.js" ></script>
        <script src="/js/threejs/0.91.0/controls/OrbitControls.js" ></script>
 
        <!-- My demo -->
        <script src="orbit-controls/js/main.js"></script>
 
    </body>
</html>
```

If all goes well I should now be able to use the OrbitControls constructor just like any other constructor in three.js.

### 3.2 - js (r91)

Now for the javaScript for this basic orbit controls example.

```js
(function () {
 
    // Scene
    var scene = new THREE.Scene();
 
    // Camera
    var camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(45, 4/3, .5, 100);
    camera.position.set(2, 2, 2);
    camera.lookAt(0, 0, 0);
 
    // Orbit Controls
    var controls = new THREE.OrbitControls(camera);

    // Something to look at
    scene.add(new THREE.Mesh(
        new THREE.BoxGeometry(1, 1, 1), 
        new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({
            color: 0xff0000,
            wireframe: true
        })));
 
    // Render
    var renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer();
    renderer.setSize(320, 240);
    document.getElementById('demo').appendChild(renderer.domElement);

    // loop
    function animate() {
 
        requestAnimationFrame(animate);
        controls.update();
        renderer.render(scene, camera);
 
    };
 
    animate();
 
}());
```

From here I have my basic example of how to go about using the orbit controls to quickly allow for the basic control of the camera that is typical of many games, and 3d modeling programs. From here it is just a question if you want to further tweak the behavior of the controls, there are plenty of additional properties to do that.

## 4 - AutoRotate

A common task with any three.js project is to have the camera rotate around a mesh or scene that you have made. With the orbit controls constructor there is an boolean that can be set true to start an automation rotation around a target position.

```js
var controls = new THREE.OrbitControls(camera);
 
// auto rotate
controls.autoRotate = true;
controls.autoRotateSpeed = 1;
controls.target = new THREE.Vector3(.5, .5, .5);
```

By default the target position is the origin, but you can use the vector3 to change it to another point. Speed can be set as well by giving a Number to the autoRotateSpeed property where 1 will mean it will take about a minute to make one rotation ad sixty frames per second.

## 5 - Min max values

There are a bunch of properties that can be used to set man and max values for the two angles of rotation [Azimuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azimuth), and Polar angle of the [Spherical coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_coordinate_system).

```js
//  horizontally angle control
controls.minAzimuthAngle = -Math.PI / 4;
controls.maxAzimuthAngle = Math.PI / 4;
 
// vertical angle control
controls.minPolarAngle = -Math.PI / 2;
controls.maxPolarAngle = Math.PI / 2;
```

There are also a bunch of other values that can be used to set limits on distance, and paining. The range of the values for the min, and max values for the angles range from -Math.PI to Math.PI

## 6 - Set the panning mode

There is an option to set the panning mode for panning. By default the orbit controls use Screen Space Panning, but it can be set to Horizontal Panning if desired.

```js
// HorizontalPanning ( 0 ScreenSpacePanning is the default)
controls.panningMode = 1;
```

## 7 - Enable Damping

There is the Enable Damping Boolean value that can be set true to give the controls some inertia. If you enable this you may also want to play around with the damping factor value as well.

```js
controls.enableDamping = true;
controls.dampingFactor = .2;
```

## 8 - Disables right clicking on the page

One thing about the Orbit Controls is that it ends up disabling right clicking on the page in which I am using it, in most cases this does not present a problem. If for some reason it does the reason why is because event.preventDefault is used in an on context menu event handler in the Orbit Controls source file, disabling it would be as simple as just commenting it out or removing the code all together.

The code of interest looks like this
```js
function onContextMenu( event ) {
 
    if ( scope.enabled === false ) return;
 
    event.preventDefault();
 
}

scope.domElement.addEventListener( 'contextmenu', onContextMenu, false );
```

## 9 - Other Controls of interest

If you take a look at the [other controls](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/r125/examples/js/controls) in the three.js examples folder it looks like there are some additional options for quickly adding some typical controls to a three.js project, including [fly controls](/2021/05/05/threejs-fly-controls/). I have not check out all of these options yet as there is a lot to get to when it comes to looking I to what there is to worth with in the official three.js repo, but I feel they might also come in handy at some point as well I am sure.

## 10 - Conclusion

I have not covered everything that the Orbit controls has to offer. It looks like it has some methods for saving and loading camera save states among other things but you get the idea. If you are thinking about taking the time to make your own controls for something like this think again, chances are it has been done before, and there is so shame of just taking advantage of these things like this to save time. The focus on any three.js project, or any project for that matter should be whatever it is that sets your project apart from all others. Chances are that is not going to be the orbit controls is it? I didn't think so, just use this stuff and move on.
