I want to write a few posts on [express examples](/2019/04/30/express-example/) that are actual full working application examples, rather than just simple hello world type examples. There is of course the typical todo app that is often the case, but I want to make a few more that go beyond that into other examples as well. As of late I have been transitioning from using windows to linux, and so far have been having a hard time finding a text editor that stacks up to notepad++ which I have grown accustomed to in windows. So why not make my own text editor on top of node.js, and express that I can take with me to any operating system that I can get node.js installed on? Sounds like a good idea to me compared to being dependent on a windows exclusive app, so I put together a quick basic [expressjs](https://expressjs.com/) powered text editor example.

## 1 - Express example basics

For the sake of this post I am thinking more in terms of an express example that is starting to look like an actual project of one sort or another rather than a more basic example. If you are new to express you might want to start with my getting started post on express, and also my main post on express as well. I also assume that you have loged a fair amount of time playing around with javaScript and node.js in general, I will not be getting into that or anything else that is outside the scope of this post.
