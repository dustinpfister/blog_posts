This week I wanted to aim for making at least one new [canvas examples](/2020/03/23/canvas-example/) post even if it is purely just for the sake of having some fun. I do not spend that much time playing games these days, but I do have a few installed on my phone and one that I have been playing around with a bit is called [a planet of mine](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tuesdayquest.myplanet&hl=en_US).
