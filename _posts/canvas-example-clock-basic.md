For today I would like to write another post about a [canvas example](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial), because canvas is fun and life is short. Todays post on canvas examples will be an example of a basic clock. Making clocks is func because doing so is easy, but there is also lots of room when it comes to doing things that are original with it.
