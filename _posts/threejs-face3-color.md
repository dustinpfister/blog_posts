It is time for me to revisit the face3 constructor in three.js, in fact I will be writing more content on threejs in general in the next few days. Todays post will be on face3 color, that is setting colors for each vertex in a face3 instance and how to use it with a material and mesh. In This post I will be going over some examples of the face3 constrictor in general, but this will mostly be on face3 color.
