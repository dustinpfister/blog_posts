In the home folder of most Linuyx systems that use bash as the command shell there should be a hidden file called .bashrc. This file will be called each time I start a new terminal window, so it is a good place to do things like set what the format of the bash command prompt should be. However there are many other things that I can do with the script, and one such thing that is pretty helpful is setting up some aliases for commands.
