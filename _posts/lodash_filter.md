It has been a few months sense the last time I wrote a post on [lodash](https://lodash.com/), as I have been trying to find other great things in the javaScript word to write about such as [phaser](/categories/phaser/), and [three.js](/categories/three-js/). However lodash is very popular, and content on it is very much in demand, so maybe I should get back into it for a while, make some new posts, and improve some old ones.

Looking over what [I have on lodash](/categories/lodash) so far I am surprised that I forgot to write one on [\_.filter method](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.10#filter), also oddly enough I don't have any post on the core js Array.filter equivalent as well. So for the heck of it why not write one on \_.filter and how it compares to what is in javaScript by itself, as there are a lot of lodash methods that are like that.
