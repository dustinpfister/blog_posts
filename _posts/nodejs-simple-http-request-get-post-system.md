A while back I made a simple nodejs script that is a basic drop in script that can be used to start a simple static sever. It is the kind of script that might not be a good choice to use in production, but when it comes to a simple pet project where I just want to host a public folder over the http protocol it seems to work okay thus far. Anyway the thought occurred that it would be nice to have another similar vanilla javaScript type solution for setting up this kind of script for a project only this time make it a script that is a slightly more advanced and will respond to post requests.
