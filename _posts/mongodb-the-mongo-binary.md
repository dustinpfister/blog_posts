The [mongo binary](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongo/) in [mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/) is a tool that can be used to interact with mongodb. It is not the service that runs in the background that responds to requests that would be [mongod](/2018/07/08/mongodb-the-mongod-binary/). Still the mongo binary is a usful tool that can be used to run [mongodb shell scripts](/2018/07/05/mongodb-making-shell-scripts/) that can be used for various admin tasks such as setting up a user account with read only access.
