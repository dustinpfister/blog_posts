I think that in order to learn more about how to use a Linux system one thing that should happen is to become more familiar with the various folders that branch off from root in a Linux system. Do not get me wrong I think there is a whole lot more that needs to happen beyond just that such as learning at least a thing or two about bash. However the thing about that is the bash is one of many commands that are in, you guessed it, the bin folder.
