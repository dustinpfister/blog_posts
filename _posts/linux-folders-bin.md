I think that in order to learn more about how to use a Linux system one thing that should happen is to become more familiar with the various folders that branch off from root in a Linux system, such as the [\/bin folder](https://ostoday.org/linux/what-is-bin-in-linux.html) which is what I will be writing about in todays post. Do not get me wrong I think there is a whole lot more that needs to happen beyond just that such as learning at least a thing or two about bash. However the thing about that is the bash is one of many commands that are in, you guessed it, the bin folder. 

The bin folder is one of several typical folders that contain binaries, or programs that are used from the bash command line, the one thing that makes the bin folder stand out from the others is that it would seem that many of the binaries in this folder seem to be very important with respect to starting and using Linux itself. Without the bin folder there is no way that there would be a function system, however many binaries in other folders such a the \/usr\/sbin\/ folder many not be so critical the the functionally of Linux itself.
