I think that in order to learn more about how to use a Linux system one thing that should happen is to become more familiar with the various folders that branch off from root in a Linux system, such as the [\/bin folder](https://ostoday.org/linux/what-is-bin-in-linux.html) which is what I will be writing about in todays post. Do not get me wrong I think there is a whole lot more that needs to happen beyond just that, such as learning at least a thing or two about bash, and maybe [writing a bash script or two](/2020/11/27/linux-bash-script/). However the thing about that is the bash is one of many commands that are in, you guessed it, the bin folder. 

The bin folder is one of several typical folders that contain binaries, or programs that are used from the bash command line, the one thing that makes the bin folder stand out from the others is that it would seem that many of the binaries in this folder seem to be very important with respect to starting and using Linux itself. Without the bin folder there is no way that there would be a function system, however many binaries in other folders such a the \/usr\/sbin\/ folder many not be so critical the the functionally of Linux itself.

## 1 - Basics of the \/bin folder in Linux

In this section I will just be going over a few key points about the \/bin folder in Linux.

### 1.1 - Using the type bash built in command to find out if a command is a \/bin folder command or not

There are a number of commands that are built into bash actually, many of which are very useful and the type command is without question one of them. For example if I use the type command and pass the bash command as the first and only positional argument I will get a file path location to the bash command. As such the bash command is indeed in the \.bin folder, and ash such bash is one great example of what the \/bin folder is all about. The bash command is pretty important in order to do much of anything at all with Linux, even if you do not use it by way of the command line it is safe to say that you would not have a functioning system without it.

## 2 - Conclusion

There is a whole lot more ground to cover when it comes to the various commands that can be found in the bin folder. However for the most part I think I have at least touched base on what the bin folder is all about for now, and that is all I really wanted to do when writing this post. I have all ready wrote a post on the [home folder in Linux systems](/2021/11/12/linux-folders-home/), and as tie goes by I am planing to write at least a few more posts on the various folders in Linux.
