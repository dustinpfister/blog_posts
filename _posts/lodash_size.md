Getting the length of an array is a trivial matter in javaScript, but then there is getting the length of Objects that is a little not so trivial. In [lodash](https://lodash.com/) there is the [\_.size](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.10#size) that is a collection method that will work with both arrays, and objects to return the element length of an array, or the number of enumerable properties of a plain old object. In this post I will be quickly covering the \_.size method, but will also be going over vanilla js solutions for doing this as well.
