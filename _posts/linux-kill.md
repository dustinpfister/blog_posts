The [Linux kill](https://www.linux.com/training-tutorials/how-kill-process-command-line/) command can be used to kill a process by way of a process id. In addition there are other commands such as killall that can be used to kill all processes by a command name rather than a process id. In any case in order to kill a commnd I first needto find out what processes are currently running on the computer so there are a few other comands that should at least be touched on breefly such as the Linux ps command that can be used to get a list of processes.
