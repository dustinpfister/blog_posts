The app.post method can be used in [express.js](https://expressjs.com/) to define what is to be done in the event that a post request is received from a client system. Working with express post requests can be a somewhat complicated process, there is much to cover in terms of hwo to go about making a client system that will send post requests, and also how to parse the incoming request as well. I will not be going into every little detail about this in this post of course, but I will be covering some basic examples, and link to other relevant works when it comes to how to get up and running with express post requests.
