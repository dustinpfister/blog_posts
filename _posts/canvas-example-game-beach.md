For this weeks [canvas example](/2020/03/23/canvas-example/) I started working on an idea that I had for a simple strategy type game. The basic idea of what I had in mind is just a simple 2d grid with three index values for ground types that are water, beach, and land. The player can build structures on land, but not on beach or water cells. In the water enemy boats can spawn and attempt to attack and invade the beach.

## Conclusion

This might end up being one of my canvas example that I might keep coming back to now and then in an effort to break the habit of starting a project but never really finishing it. I like how it is turning out so far, but this one does need a whole lot more work, and I am also not completely sure what the finished product will be if I keep working at it. The main thing I wanted t focus on with this one is to just try to make something that is fun.

With that being said maybe I will keep working on this canvas example, and if so I am sure i will come back and expand this post even further. I would like to break the habit once and for all, if not with this canvas example, [one of them at least](/2020/03/23/canvas-example/).
