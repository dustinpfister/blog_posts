As yes [vue bind](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/syntax.html) may refer to one of the many ways to bind some text to an element in a vue js template. There are text nodes, there are attribute names and values for elements, and then there is raw html as well. There are a few ways to go about binding something to a template in vue js depending on what it is that needs to be bound to a template, so lets take a look at some vue bind examples today.

<!-- more -->

## 1 - Vue bind text

So when it comes to binding text to an element in a template there is the mustache syntax that can be used of course, however there is also the v-text built in directive as well that can be used as a way to bind text from a property in the vue data object to a text node in a template.

```js
new Vue({
    el: '#demo-bind',
    template: '<div>' +
    '<p>{{ mess1 }}</p>' +
    '<p v-text=\"mess2\"></p>' +
    '</div>',
    data: {
        mess1: 'mustache syntax',
        mess2: 'bind text directive'
    }
});
```

Binding text is one thing but what about attributes ans raw html, well lets take at some more examples that involve binding in vuejs.

## 2 - Attribute vue bind directive for element attributes

When it comes to binding a value in the vue data object to a text node that can be done with the mustache syntax just fine, bit it will not aways work out so great when attempting to bind a value to an html element attribute value in a template. If you are running into trouble when that one you will want to check out the v-bind directive.

```js
new Vue({
    el: '#demo-bind',
    template: '<p v-bind:style="red">red text</p>',
    data: {
        red: 'color:red;'
    }
});```

## 3 - Binding raw html

Then there is of course raw html and how to go about binding that to a vue template. Well there was once a time when a special syntax similar to the mustache syntax could be used but in 2.x of vuejs that is no longer the case. However there is now the v-html directive that can be used as a way to bind raw html to a vue template.

```js
new Vue({
    el: '#demo-bind',
    template: '<div v-html="html"></div>',
    data: {
        html: 'This is some html'
    }
});
```
