Every once in a while I want to delete end of line characters, or transform characters from some standard input when piping two or more Linux commands together. So far I have found that the [Linux awk](/2021/07/02/linux-awk/) command might be the best tool for the job when it comes to thing and just about everything else when it comes to text processing type tasks. However there are also a lot of various alternative commands that come up and one of them is the Linux tr command.
