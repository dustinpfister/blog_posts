A log time ago I wrote a post on the [basic material](/2018/05/05/threejs-basic-material/) in [three js](https://threejs.org/), but oddly enough I never got around to writing a post on the [standard material](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/materials/MeshStandardMaterial) in threejs. When it comes to materials in threejs the basic material is a nice starting point, and in some examples and projects in which I am not doing anything with light it might even get the job done just fine. However when it comes to working with everything that three.js has to offer when it comes to light sources, and the various kinds of texture maps the standard material is maybe one of the best options to go with.
