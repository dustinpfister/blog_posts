For this weeks post I worked out another [threejs example](/2021/02/19/threejs-examples/), this time it is a module that helps me break down a project into a kind of timeline.

## The Timeline module and what to know first

This is a post in which I am writing about a javaScript mpodule that I might use in one or more future video projects if I refine it a bit more. This is not in any way a post on getting started with threejs or any addtional skills that are needed before hand with things like javaScript in general for example. I have all ready wrote getting started type posts on threejs, and javaScript a long time ago. I have also wrote posts on many threejs various threejs features alone. This is just one of my many threejs example posts where the goal is to make some kind of final project. This can be some kind of full applaction, however often it is a module that I would use in an over all applaction such is the case here.

### Source code is also up on Github

The soucre code that I am writing about in this post can also be found in my [test threejs reposatory up on Github](https://github.com/dustinpfister/test_threejs/tree/master/views/forpost/threejs-examples-timeline). This is also where I park the source code examples for my many [other posts on threejs as well](/categories/three-js/).
