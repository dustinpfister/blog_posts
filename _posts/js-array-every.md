The [Array every](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/every) method of the [Array prototype](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array) in native javaScript is a way to test if all elements in an array will meet a given condition or not. In the event that just one element in the array does not meet the condition, then the end result will be false. This method is then similar to that of the [array some](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/some) method that will return true if just one of the elements in the array will pass the test.

This week I think I will write a few new posts on native javaScript features that I have not got around to writing about yet.
