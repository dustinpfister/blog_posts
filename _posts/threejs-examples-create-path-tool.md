Lately I have been taking another look into [curves in threejs](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/extras/core/Curve) by making a few quick demos of the [Quadratic Bezier curve3 constructor](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/extras/curves/QuadraticBezierCurve3) which is one of several options to create a curve apart from creating a custom curve. There are a number of uses for creating curves, but for the most part my interest in them is to explore what my options are for coming up with a javaScript project that helpers me define the movement of object3d based objects, mainly mesh objects and cameras.
