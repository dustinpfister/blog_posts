Lately I have been taking another look into [curves in threejs](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/extras/core/Curve) by making a few quick demos of the [Quadratic Bezier curve3 constructor](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/extras/curves/QuadraticBezierCurve3) which is one of several options to create a curve apart from creating a custom curve. There are a number of uses for creating curves, but for the most part my interest in them is to explore what my options are for coming up with a javaScript project that helpers me define the movement of object3d based objects, mainly mesh objects and cameras.

## The first prototype of the tool thus far \(r0\).


## Conclusion

Event with what I have together thus far I am ready have the core idea of what I want working, but now the question is do I put more time into this in order to add the additional features that I want. It would be nice to have some kind of tool in which I can adjust things my just clicking and dragging mesh objects as a way to change the start point, end point, and control point. However I have found that I can also just manually define these when working out the  source code for a video project also, and doing so is not all that time consuming thus far.

I have found that if I use a tool often enough I will get around to making improvements to it now and then, otherwise it will just be yet another one of my unfinished projects that is just the core idea up and running and that is it.
