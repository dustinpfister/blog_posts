There should be standard way to go about making an object in three.js visible or not just like that of the visible and display css properties when it comes to styling some html. It would seem that there is such a standard property which would be the visible property of the Object3d class in threejs, this property is a boolean value that is set to true by default and is used as a way to inform a renderer if the given mesh should even be rendered or not.
