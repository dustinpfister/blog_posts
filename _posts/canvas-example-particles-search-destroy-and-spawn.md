For todays quick [canvas example](/2020/03/23/canvas-example/) post I thought I would make a simple example that is some display objects moving around a canvas. There will be just two types of display object one of which is none, and the other is a hunter. Hunters will hurt non hunter display objects, and any display object that will have zero hit points will be purged from a pool of display objects. There will also be a simple method for spawning display objects back into the pool of display objects.

So this canvas example will just be an exercise of many aspects of canvas projects.
