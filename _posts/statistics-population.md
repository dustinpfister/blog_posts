A Statistical population is not always what the name might suggest. A Statistical population could be census data, however it could also be just about any collection of standard data in general actually. Much of what is done in statistics involves at least some kind of collection of data, in some kind of standard from. Things are then drawn from that population of data than can then be used to make sense of it.

For example say you have a population of data that is a collection of objects, and each object represents certain properties of a Blog post on a website. The properties might be the total word count of the post, the subject, how much traffic it received, and how much money it made over a certain uniform time period.
