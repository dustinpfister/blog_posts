A [Statistical population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_population) is not always what the name might suggest. A Statistical population could be census data, however it could also be just about any collection of standard data in general actually. Much of what is done in statistics involves at least some kind of collection of data, in some kind of standard from. Things are then drawn from that population of data than can then be used to make sense of it.

For example say you have a population of data that is a collection of objects, and each object represents certain properties of a Blog post on a website. The properties might be the total word count of the post, the subject, how much traffic it received, and how much money it made over a certain uniform time period. There would then be all kinds of additional code that can be used to pull samples from that collection of objects, and generate other populations of objects that might contain the average amount of money made per word per post collection for example. The results can then be presented in the from of graphs, sorted indexes, and any other means to help paint a picture of what is working, and what is not. Knowledge of the results can then be used to make informed derisions when it comes to what to write about next, and what content might need additional attention when  it comes to editing and promotion.
