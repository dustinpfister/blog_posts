For the past few days I have been exploring node.js powered options when it comes to walking over the contents of a file system. I have been looking at methods in the node.js fs module that can be used to just start doing soething like this from the ground up, as well as npm packages. Im my travels I have found what looks like maybe one of the most popular soultions when it comes to npm packages that is just simply called [walk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/walk). In this post I will be covering the use of walk to just get this aspect of development over with quickly.
