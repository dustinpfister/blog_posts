So in javaScript the Object.create method or [\_.create](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.10#create) in [lodash](https://lodash.com/) might come up now and then in many code examples. This is a method that can be used to create a new object with a given object that will function as the new objects prototype object. If you are still new to javaScript the prototype is something that you should become familial with at some point sooner or later, as it is a major part of javaScript development. In this post I will be giving some use case examples, and hopefully give at least a basic idea of what the create object method is all about.
