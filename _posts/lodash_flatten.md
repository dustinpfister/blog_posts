So some of the method in [lodash](https://lodash.com/) are can come in handy, and really do help to save time with certain projects, todays post on lodash is one of those methods which is [\_.flatten](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.10#flatten). The \_.flatten, and also \_.flattenDeep methods are one of many methods that help with the task of working with arrays of arrays, or multi dimensional arrays in javaScript. Flatten can be used to flatten down an array of arrays into a single array, thus making it a method that can be thought of as a reversal of [\_.chunk](/2017/09/13/lodash-chunk/).
