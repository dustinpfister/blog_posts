So these days I have been experimenting with express as a way to make node.js powered full stack applications. In many of these simple projects I have been using lowdb as a database solution, which works fine when it comes to simple projects that are going to be used off line. However if I aim to make something that will be deployed to a server, I am going to want to use something a little more professional, for this there is of course mongodb, and mongoose.js. This post will be a getting stared post on using mongoose.js to work with mongodb as a database solution.
