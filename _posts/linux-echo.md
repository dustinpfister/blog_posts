So this will be a quick post on using the linux echo command and node.js when it comes to creating shell scripts with javaScript rather than the usual Bourne Shell. The echo command just simply prints something to the standard output, in some cases now and then I find myself using it. For example just simply piping in some kind of simple test input to a CLI tools standard input I am putting together that will accept such input from something else when it comes to a read use case scenario.
