This will be a quick post on the JSON.parse method which is a native javaScript built in way to parse a JSON string into a workable object at least on all modern platforms anyway. The use of the method is fairly straight forward just call the method off of the json object and pass a json string to parse into an object, the returned object is then the workable object from that json string. There are still a few additional things a javaScript developer should be ware of such as browser support, what happens when an invalid string is passed, and some additional related methods and features.
