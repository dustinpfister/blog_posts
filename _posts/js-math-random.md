Starting out with the [Math.random](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random) method in javaScript is simple enough, you just call it and you get a random number between 0 and 1. From there it is all about what you do with that value when it comes to doing something random.
