The [onfocus event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/GlobalEventHandlers/onfocus) in javaScript is an event that will fire when the user focus on an element. This often happens when a user clicks on an element, but the event does behave a little different from a click event. In this post I will be covering some quick examples when it comes to working with focus javaScript events, how to attach handers for such events, and how to simulate them as well with the [focus](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/focus) method of an element.
