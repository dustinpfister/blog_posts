This year I wanted to start looking into how to go about using electronjs, and so far I have a small collection of tech demos, and hello world type programs that make use of various features of electronjs to make desktop applications with html and javaScript. Over the long term though I am going to want to make at least one or two actual programs that I use to make some kind of content. With that said I have a simple text editor program in the works, but for todays post I am going to be writing about the current state of something that I have been putting a whole lot more time into to make videos that I am calling VideoGround.

Over the years I have wrote a whole [lot of posts on threejs](/categories/three-js/) which is a popular javaScript library that has to do with 3d modeling. I have learned, and continue to learn, a whole lot about threejs, and also while I am at it 3d modeling in general inside and outside of threejs. I also like vuejs when it comes to using a front end framework, and I have also log a fair amount of time working with nodejs as well when it comes to working in a javaScript environment outside of a web browser. So then working on a project like this allows me to use, refresh, and refine knowledge of a wide range of skills that I developed over many years. However the main motivation with this is to also make something that is fun.
