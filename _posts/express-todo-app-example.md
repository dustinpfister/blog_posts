So I have been working with [express.js](https://expressjs.com/) for a while now when it comes to making simple demos, but now I think it is time to start making something that is a full working project of some kind. Often people start with a simple todo list project of some kind, so maybe that will do for now. I do not have to make this the kind of project that I will devote a few years of my life to, it can just be a good start. In this post I will be writing about this first express.js project, and if all goes well maybe this will not be the last post like this, as I progress into something else that is more interesting.
