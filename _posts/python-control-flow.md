This week I have started [learning python](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/) just for the sake of picking another programing language other than javaScript. So one big part of larning a new language is to learn what there is to work with when it comes to [control flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_flow). That is how to go about writing basic elements of code such as if statements, while loops, and other elements of a langaue that control the flow of a program.

## 1 - if statements

First off are if statements.

```python
x = 5
y = 10
if x < 10:
  print('x is less')
print('done')
```

## 2 - While loops

## 3 - for loops

## 4 - break continue
