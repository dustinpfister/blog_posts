This week I have started [learning python](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/) just for the sake of picking another programing language other than javaScript. So one big part of larning a new language is to learn what there is to work with when it comes to [control flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_flow). That is how to go about writing basic elements of code such as if statements, while loops, and other elements of a langaue that control the flow of a program.

## 1 - if statements

First off what it comes to control flow and python is if statements. This is one of the first things I would want to get solid not just with python, but any new langauge. They work more or less like if statements in any other lanague so maybe there is onyl so much to write about them, but never the less in this section I am going to go over everything that I think is important.

### 1.1 - Basic if statement example

To write an if statement, I just need to start with the if keyword, followed by an expression, and then finish with a colon. Then in the next line I just need to intendt to start a block of code that will run if the expression evaluates to true.

```python
x = 5
y = 10
if x < 10:
  print('x is less')
print('done')
```

## 2 - While loops

## 3 - for loops

## 4 - break continue
