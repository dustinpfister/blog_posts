This will be a quick post on string methods in the popular javaScript library known as [lodash](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15). The main reason why I am bothering with this is that I have wrote posts on [lodash collection methods](/2022/01/14/lodash_collection) in general, as well as [object methods](/2019/02/13/lodash_object/), and [array methods](/2019/02/14/lodash_array/) in lodash, so then it makes sense to write a post on the general topic of working with strings and loash.
