This will be a quick post on string methods in the popular javaScript library known as [lodash](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15). The main reason why I am bothering with this is that I have wrote posts on [lodash collection methods](/2022/01/14/lodash_collection) in general, as well as [object methods](/2019/02/13/lodash_object/), and [array methods](/2019/02/14/lodash_array/) in lodash, so then it makes sense to write a post on the general topic of working with strings and loash.

## 1 - The Basics of strings and working with lodash

In this section I will be starting out with a few quick examples of using lodash to work with strings. This will not be an overview of the various lodash string methods, or how to go about doing similar things without the use of lodash, as these are things that I will intend to get to in later sections in this post.

### 1.1 - Basic example using strings and lodash

Maybe a good hello would type of method to start out with would be the [split method](/2018/12/03/lodash_split/), if I pass a string as the first argument an then a string to split by as the second the result will be an array where each element is a sub string between each instance of the string that was given to split the source string with.

```js
let a = _.split(',1,2,3,', ',');
console.log(a);
// [ '', '1', '2', '3', '' ]
```

So then the lodash split is an example of a method that will take a string as a first argument and then the method returns an array. Although the return value is an array the source that that method works with is very much a string, so then it is a kind of string method in lodash. However often one will need to also work with other lodash methods that are array methods, collection methods, or object methods in order to complete some kind of over all greater task. As you can see the end result of this example is an array with some empty strings as elements, as such I will typically want those elements removed, and then do something more with the array after that.

### 1.2 - The chain method with split, map and join

So now that I have a very basic hello world style example out of the way when it comes to string methods in lodash the next step might be something a little more advanced. When it comes to chaining methods in lodash there are a few options to choose from, one of which is the [lodash chain](/2018/11/11/lodash_chain/) method. When calling the chain method the first method that I can pass to it could be a string value, but then when it comes to calling another method off of chain it will then need to be a string method, or at least some method that will work with a string value. As with the basic example above this can be the split method again for examples as that is of course a string method in lodash.

After the split method is called then I can use some kind of method in lodash that will work with an array to remove those empty string values that I do not want. There are a few options for this, one of which is the [compact method](/2018/08/09/lodash_compact/) that works well for this examples at least. I can then use the clean array of the empty string removed now with another method such as the [lodash map collection method](/2018/02/02/lodash_map/) to create an array of values based off of the values from the source string. There is then array methods that can be used to create a string primitive value from an array of values, one such options with this would be the [join method](/2018/08/11/lodash_join/).

```js
let a = _.chain(',1,2,3,4,').split(',').compact().map((n) => Math.pow(2, n) ).join(' ').value();
console.log(a);
// 2 4 8 16
```

### 1.3 - The lodash words method

For another example of basic lodash string methid examples another good one to cover right away would be the lodash words method.

```js
let a = _.chain('This is some Text').words().value();
console.log(a);
// 2 4 8 16
```

## 2 - Some lodash string methods

Now that I have some ery basics of string methods in lodash, and how to use them with other lodash methods, in this section I will be going over some of the various string methods in lodash. I will not be going over every one of them here of course, if you really want to know what each of them are you can always go to the lodash documentation website first and foremost. However I think I should at least briefly go over a few of them to say the least before moving on to something else in this post.

### 2.1 - The deburr method

The lodash deburr method is a method that can be used to convert the characters of text from various languages to an equivalent character that is in the ASCII range.

```js
let spanish = 'Jalape√±o';
console.log(_.deburr(spanish));
// Jalapeno
```

### 2.2 - lodash escape and escaping for html

The escape method can be used to escape text so that it will render as plain text rather than html. However it is just that kine of escape for text, when it comes to urls, or anything else to that effect this method will fall short.

```js
let a = _.escape('Some times < text & code > things need to be escaped');
console.log(a);
// Some times &lt; text &amp; code &gt; things need to be escaped
```

### 2.3 - lodash pad

The lodash pad method, as well as several other similar methods can be used to create a new string that contains additional padding to the left or right of the string, up to a set size.

```js
let an = 1503345; 
console.log(_.pad(an,10,'0'));      // 0150334500
console.log(_.padEnd(an,10,'0'));   // 1503345000
console.log(_.padStart(an,10,'0')); // 0001503345
```

## 3 - Vanilla javaScript and Strings

In just about all of my posts on lodash I also write at least a thing or two about doing what it is that can be done with lodash, with just javaScript itself. Some times in order to do so it does in fact take a lot to recreate the functionality of what a lodash methods does. However more often than not, speaking from my experience thus far, replacing a lodash method with vanilla javaScript often just requires a little additional code, and in many cases there is a native counterpart method built into core javaScript itself.

When it comes to [Strings in javaScript](/2019/01/25/js-javascript-string/) there is of course everything that can be done with the javaScript language itself when it comes to creating them, making comparisons with string values, what the boolean value of a string value is when empty compared to one that is of one or more characters and so forth. On top of that there are also a wide range of methods to work with when it comes to the prototype object of a string instance in javaScript also. On top of that when it comes to chaining there is also working with the various other prototypes when for example using the split method of the string instance to create an array, then using one or more [array prototype methods](/2018/12/10/js-array/).

### 3.1 - Splitting a string

As with the lodash split method there is also a native [split method](/2021/07/14/js-string-split/) in the string prototype.

```js
let a = ',1,2,3,'.split(',');
console.log(a);
// [ '', '1', '2', '3', '' ]
```

### 3.2 - Working with a chain

Now for an example of a chain in native javaScript like that of the one in the basic section above. Here is am once again using the string split method to split a string into an array of sub strings. I then have an array, so I can then use array prototype methods like [filter](/2020/10/03/js-array-filter/), and [reduce](/2021/07/13/js-array-reduce/) both of which work well for getting rid of those empty string elements I do not want. There is then also an [array map method](/2020/06/16/js-array-map/) that I can use to create new values for each element in the resulting array, and also a [join array method](/2020/03/09/js-array-join/) that can be used to set the array back to a string value.

```js
let a = ',1,2,3,'.split(',')
.reduce((acc, el) => {
    if(el != ''){
        acc.push(el);
    }
    return acc;
}, [])
.map((el)=>{
    return Math.pow(2, el);
})
.join('-');
console.log(a);
// 2-4-8
```

### 3.2 - Search and replace

The [replace string method](/2019/04/08/js-string-replace/) can be used to replace one or more instances of a text pattern with another.

```js
let a = 'This will not work'.replace('not', 'can');
console.log(a); // 'This will can work'
```

## 4 - Conclusion

String methods in lodash help with various typical tasks with strings, but so do a wide range of methods that are there to work with in the String Prototype object of native javaScript by itself. There are a lot of things to say about lodash when in comes to redeeming qualities, but many of those qualities have to do with reasons why one might prefer a user space method over an option that is built into javaScript itself. Also when it comes to user space options that is often not just a matter of using lodash over native javaScript, but working out some kind of custom application specific revision of lodash if that makes any sense. In any case getting into the subject in detail, and doing it justice is a matter for [another post](/categories/lodash/).
