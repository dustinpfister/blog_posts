The on visibility change event of the document object in client side javaScript will fire each time the content of a web page will become visible or hidden. So in other words this event will fire each time the tab of a browser window will become visible or invisible as a user switches from one tab to another. This event can be used with other properties of the document object to define logic that is to be applied each time a page becomes hidden or visible.
