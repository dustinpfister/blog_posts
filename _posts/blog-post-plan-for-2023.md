Yet another year has past and as such it is time for me to write another one of these [blog posts on blogging](/categories/blog) that I write only once a year as of late. I like to keep the focus more so on tech related topics on this site as it is a github pages website after all, however I do want to keep up with this at least every once in a great while. There is what I am doing that seems to be working a little, but I still have more to learn when it comes to how to go about writing a blog that people will want to read. So I should take a moment to blog about blogging in a effort to make sure that I keep going with what is working, and rethink what I am doing with what is not working.

## 1 - Continue to focus on Quality of content rather than trying to be everywhere.

When I was first starting out with blogging and starting to see that I was in fact starting to gain some organic impressions and traffic I started to develop this desire to be everywhere. That is to write content about every subject in tech that I know a thing or two about, and also a whole lot about things that I do not know that much about but am very much interested in. I wanted to just start writing about more or less everything, and also wanted to be everywhere. I wanted to spread a far and wide net in an effort to maximize the volume of impressions and in theory also traffic. This of course over the long run proved to be a mistake, and as such last year I started an effort to pick just one or two topics and stay in my lane with them sort of speak.
