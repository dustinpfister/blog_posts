I have been [writing posts](/categories/express/) on [express.js](https://expressjs.com/), and am now at a point in which I am just making some projects based that include express.js. I have a post on a basic express todo app, a middleware that responds to requests with json, and now the project that I am going to write in this post that has to do with using three.js to visualizing my google analytics data.
