This post will be on a fixed shooter hybrid [canvas example](/2020/03/23/canvas-example/) game, like that of [centipede](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centipede_(video_game)). The game is like a fixed shooter type game like that of space invaders or kaboom. However the player is able to move by two axis of movement rather than just one, but only in an area at the bottom of the screen.
