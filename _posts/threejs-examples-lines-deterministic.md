This week the focus was just on working out one new [threejs example](/2021/02/19/threejs-examples/) that has to do with creating and mutating a group of lines. I did a lot of other things this week of coarse that has to do with playing around with tube geometry, but that might be a matter for another future threejs example that will be similar to this one. This example is just a project in which I continued with my lat threejs example that also had to do with creating a group of lines but the goal was just to create a group of lines that form a sphere of sorts and then mutate things from there. With this example what I wanted to do is make a similar system of sorts, but to make it so that a group of lines that form a sphere is just one of many options.
