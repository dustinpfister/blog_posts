This will be a post on the [node command](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html) that is used to start nodejs projects written in javaScript. The node command is used to run scripts written in javaScript by way of an external javaScript file, or other means such as from the command line via the eval option. This post is mainly aimed at developers that are new to nodejs, but even if you are a more seasoned nodejs developer there might be a few more aspects of using the node command that you might not yet be aware of that might be of use in some situations when it comes to advanced topics such as [piping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(Unix)).
