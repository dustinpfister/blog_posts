I took the time to write a post or two on some of the various built in geometry constructor functions that there are to work with in threejs such as the box geometry constructor. However I have not yet got around to writing one on cylinder geometry, so I though that this weeks post should be just a quick post on this constrcuor as well on top of the older ones that I have wrote. One interesting thing about the cylinder geometry constrcuor is that I can give both a top, and bottom radius and when doing so I can set a radius of zero for one of these which allows me to use this is a replacment for the cone geometry constructor. So like many of the other built in geometry constrcuors I can make a few shapes other than that of a cylinder actaully depepding on the argument values that I give when calling it.
