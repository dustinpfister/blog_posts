There are a lot of texture maps that can be used with the various materials in[threejs](https://threejs.org/docs/#manual/en/introduction/Creating-a-scene), such as using a basic color map with the basic material, or an alpha map to adjust transparency of a material based on the state of a texture. I am not sure if I will every get around to writing posts on every kind of map there is to be aware of in threejs, but there are some that really stand out for me more than others and one of these map options is an emissive map.
