The [lsb_release command](https://linux.die.net/man/1/lsb_release) can be used to find out distribution info about the Linux System that you are using. This command is part of what is called the [Linux Standard Base](https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/lsb/start) which means that it should not just simply be the kind of command that you will find in just Debian Linux Based Systems, but rather in just about any Linux Distribution as a standard command for getting basic information about what kind of Linux system I am using. There is a lot to say about LSB in general however in this post I will be focusing mainly on just the release unilty tool as another option on top of that of just using the [uname command]() which will not always give the full range of data that one would want to see when it comes to getting to know what it is that they are dealing with from one OS Image to another.
