There are a number of Vector classes in threejs such as Vector3 that is a class for a 3D vector in space which is to be expected for such a library. However there is also a Vector4 class that comes up when starting to work with quaternion objects, and also a plain old Vector2 class as well. With that said in this post I am going to be writing a thing or two about the Vector2 class, and some typical situations in which this kind of class can prove to be useful.
