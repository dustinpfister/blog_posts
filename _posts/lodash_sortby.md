So I have come to find that I like the [lodash](https://lodash.com/) [\_.sortBy](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.10#sortBy) method more so than the native Array.sort. Also it is worth pointing out that this is a collection method, so \_.sortBy is a more robust method that brings a bit more to the table. In this post I will be writing about sorting using the \_.sortBy method, and I will also be covering some vanilla js alternates as well.
