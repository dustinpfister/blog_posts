I like javaScript a lot, but I think that I am long overdue for learning at least one or two additional langauges beyonf just that of javaScript. I have staretd a collection of posts on bash scripts which I think can be thought of as another kind of lanague, although bash is only good for a very specific style of programing that has to do with automating work in a POSIX system such as Linux. Speaking of Linux I also wrote a post on gcc, and in that post I put togeather a few simple C language examples as I think that doind so is called for if I am going to write a post on gcc.

However I think that when it comes to starting another serious collection of content on another langue, maybe it would be best to start with python. I have took the time to start another personal collection of source code examples on python, and now I think that I should start writing some content on the subject.

So far there is a great deal that I like about python compared to a javaScript enviorment. I do like node still very much, but I can all ready see why a lot of people might prefer python when it comes to writing some kind of desktop applacation, of back end system. When it comes to built in modules there is just so much more to work with compared to node.
