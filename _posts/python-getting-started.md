I like javaScript a lot, but I think that I am long overdue for learning at least one or two additional langauges beyonf just that of javaScript. I have staretd a collection of posts on bash scripts which I think can be thought of as another kind of lanague, although bash is only good for a very specific style of programing that has to do with automating work in a POSIX system such as Linux. Speaking of Linux I also wrote a post on gcc, and in that post I put togeather a few simple C language examples as I think that doind so is called for if I am going to write a post on gcc.

However I think that when it comes to starting another serious collection of content on another langue, maybe it would be best to start with python. I have took the time to start another personal collection of source code examples on python, and now I think that I should start writing some content on the subject.

So far there is a great deal that I like about python compared to a javaScript enviorment. I do like node still very much, but I can all ready see why a lot of people might prefer python when it comes to writing some kind of desktop applacation, of back end system. When it comes to built in modules there is just so much more to work with compared to node.

I am still pretty new to python, but I have to say that the process of learning it is going fast. Of course I do have a lot of experence with programing, so much of what is going on is just learning how to do things I all ready know how to do just with python rather than javaScript.

So then this post is a getting started post on python, and unlike with javaScript I am now writing about getting started with poython from the prespective of someone who is still pretty new to the languge. That was not the case when I started writing about javaScript, so in time maybe writeing about pythion will help me in my effors when it comes to improveing my javaScript content. In any case lets start out with the very basics when it comes to getting started with python.
