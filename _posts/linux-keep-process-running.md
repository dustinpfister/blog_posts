These days I have been doing some work on my Raspberry PI 3B+ with a Rasberry PI OS image, and have come accross some situtsions in which I would like to continue having a command run even when I close the terminal window in which I started it. To do so I just need to use NOHUP at the end of the command line to do just that, but maybe there are a few more things to write about on top of that when it comes to starting and killing processes in a linux operating system enviornment.
