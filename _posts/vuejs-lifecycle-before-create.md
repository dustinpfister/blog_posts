The vue before create lifecycle hook is the first of many hooks that fire throughout the lifecycle of a vuejs instance. It is in this hook that I would go about doing anything that I might want to happen before the data object is created in the created hook, and it is also the very first hook that fires in the lifecycle process of a vuejs class instance.
