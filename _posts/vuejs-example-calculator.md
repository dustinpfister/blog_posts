I have not wrote a post on vuejs for a while, so I thought I would start a series of posts that are vue examples. So how about a vue calculator of sorts for starters. This will be a nice quick simple example that makes use of vue el, templates, methods and a few built in directives as well as the use of eval in javaScript to evaluate expressions.
