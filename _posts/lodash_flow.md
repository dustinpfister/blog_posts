These days I have been doing more reading on lodash and have found that I have not yet wrote a post on [\_.flow](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.4#flow) which can be used as a way to make a new function that is actually a bunch of functions that work together. There are many ways to go about chaining methods together with just plain old javaScript by itself as well though so I will be writing about vanilla js examples as well, but mainly this post is about \_.flow.
