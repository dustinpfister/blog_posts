These days I have been doing more reading on lodash and have found that I have not yet wrote a post on [\_.flow](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.4#flow) which can be used as a way to make a new function that is actually a bunch of functions that work together. There are many ways to go about chaining methods together with just plain old javaScript by itself as well though so I will be writing about vanilla js examples as well, but mainly this post is about \_.flow.

## 2 - \_.flow example involving a distance formula

The distance formula came to mind when thinking of a quick example of using flow. This might not be the best example of using \_.flow, as the formal is simple enough where it could just be expressed in a single line. Never the less if you do not have much experience with \_.flow this simple example should help give you the basic idea of why \_.flow can be useful.

### 2.1 - The vanilla js distance formula

So if I where to start working on something in javaScript that required the use of a distance formula I might add something like this in my project.

```js
let distance = function (x1, y1, x2, y2) {
    return Math.round(Math.sqrt(Math.pow(x1 - x2, 2) + Math.pow(y1 - y2, 2)));
};
 
console.log(distance(10, 15, 90, 22)); // 80
```

Maybe this method would be part of a framework, or just a stand alone method like this. However for the sake of this post that involves the use of \_.flow this is an example of something that can be broken down into a situation in which a function is created that is the result of one function flowing into another. That is instead of doing everything in a single line, I could have a method that excepts the four arguments preforms a single step, and then passes the result to the next function and so forth.

### 2.2 - Using \_.flow to break things down

Another way of producing the same method would be to use \_.flow, by passing an array of methods to it. The first method in the array would accept the four arguments and return the product of Math.pow(x1 - x2, 2) + Math.pow(y1 - y2, 2). That product will then be passed as the first argument for Math.sqrt, and then its product will be passed as the first argument of Math.round.

```js
let forA = function (a1, a2) {
    return Math.pow(a1 - a2, 2);
};
 
let dist = _.flow([
   function (x1, y1, x2, y2) {
       return forA(x1, x2) + forA(y1, y2)
   },
   Math.sqrt,
   Math.round
]);
 
console.log(dist(10, 15, 90, 22)); // 80
```
