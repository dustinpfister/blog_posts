So today I will be putting togeather another quick post on [lodash](https://lodash.com/) and corresponding vanilla js alternatives when it comes to the process of quickly padding strings. With lodash there is [\_.pad](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.10#pad), [\_.padStart](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.10#padStart), and [\_.padEnd](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.10#padEnd) that can be used to make quick work of this with lodash, if lodash is part of the stack, but I will be looking at some other options as well.
