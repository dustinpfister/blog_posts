So in many games you end up with one or more collections or groups of sprites. In this case there is a need for all kinds of methods that help with managing that group of display objects. In todays post I will be writing about grops in [Phaser ce](https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser-ce/). There are many methods, and properties with groups, so this will be just a simple getting started post on groups for now.
