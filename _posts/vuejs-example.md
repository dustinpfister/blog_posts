I have wrote over 40 posts on vuejs thus far, and many of those posts are just on various aspects of the framework itself that are all ready well documenetd in the official vuejs documentation. Write such posts are not awalys such a wast of time mind you offten the offical documention might fail to mention something, not frame things the right way, and more examples can never hurt. Still once I gain a sold hold on the basics of a framework or lanague the only thing to do from that point forward is to start to work on some actual projects, rather than fidding about with basic, copy and paste, cook book style code examples. So I have started writing a collection of posts on vuejs examples that are full working projects, or at least aim to be anyway.

I have done the same with my collection of posts on the canvas element, but this time around I think I would like to focus more so on quality rather that quanity. For now I have 10 posts on vuejs examples, and as of this writing I think that I might want to keep it at that, or if I am going to expand the collection not go that must farther then that for now. I would like to edit the older posts, and improve the underlaying code of the examples on top of that, before continuing forward in an effor to not repeat what I have done for my collection of canvas examples.
