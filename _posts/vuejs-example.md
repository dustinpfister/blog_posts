I have wrote over 40 posts on vuejs thus far, and many of those posts are just on various aspects of the framework itself that are all ready well documenetd in the official vuejs documentation. Write such posts are not awalys such a wast of time mind you offten the offical documention might fail to mention something, not frame things the right way, and more examples can never hurt. Still once I gain a sold hold on the basics of a framework or lanague the only thing to do from that point forward is to start to work on some actual projects, rather than fidding about with basic, copy and paste, cook book style code examples. So I have started writing a collection of posts on vuejs examples that are full working projects, or at least aim to be anyway.

I have done the same with my collection of posts on the canvas element, but this time around I think I would like to focus more so on quality rather that quanity. For now I have 10 posts on vuejs examples, and as of this writing I think that I might want to keep it at that, or if I am going to expand the collection not go that must farther then that for now. I would like to edit the older posts, and improve the underlaying code of the examples on top of that, before continuing forward in an effor to not repeat what I have done for my collection of canvas examples.

## 1 - Get the full source code of all of my vuejs examples at my github

The full source code for all of these vuejs examples can be found at my [test\_vuejs reposatory](https://github.com/dustinpfister/test_vuejs) here at guthub. If you have bolth git and nodejs installed then the repo can be cloned down, then npm can be used to install packages for a simple server for the examples. doing something to that effect is best when it comes to working out something with vuejs, and javaScript in general compared to viewing things with the file protocol.

```
$ git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/dustinpfister/test_vuejs
$ cd text_vuejs
$ npm install
```

The list script will set up and run a simple server that will give a list of all the examples.

```
$ npm run list 3000
```
