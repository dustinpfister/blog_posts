The Linux head command is a way to just print the first few lines of some output rather than the whole thing. In addition there is also the tail command that can be used as a way to print just the last few lines of some output. In some situations this is just what I would want to do with soem command output rather than make use of some other options, such as the less command, or redirection of output to a file that I can then option with a text editor like nano.
