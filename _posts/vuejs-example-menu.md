There is starting out with just some very basic examples of vuejs, but sooner or later there is taking the time to start to get into making some real projects with vuejs. That is, or at least should be the long term goal when it comes to learning vuejs, or any framework for that matter after all. Unless your aim is to just make blog posts on simple vuejs examples in which case I stand corrected.

Anyway for todays vuejs example I think it is a good idea to work out a simple, solid soultuon for making a kind of menu for a major applaction using vuejs. This menu will contain a main vuejs instance, but also a number of other vuejs components each of which is a menu item for an over all applaction.
