As of late I have been working on demos that have to do with Quaternion objects in order to gain a better understanding of them. Thus far I have found that there is a core set of prototype methods that I am going to want to use to start working with these. Maybe the very first method that one will want to get solid with is the set from axis angle method, but I have found that the set from unit vectors method is also often fairly useful as well. With that said todays post will be on this set from unit vectors method of the quatrenion class.
