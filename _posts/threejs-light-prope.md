So in threejs r104 light probes have been introduced. As of this writing there is not much in terms of documentation at the three.js website, but there is an official example in the github repo as well as some other assets of interest in the repo that are being used with this new three.js feature. So I played around with this in three.js, and as such I should take a moment to wrote a quick post on light probes in three.js.
