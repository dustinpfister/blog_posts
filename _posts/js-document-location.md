The [document location](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/location) object in client side javaScript is a read only object that contains the url of the current page. It can be used as a way to know the current url, as well as preform a redirect to a new location. That is because although the object itself is read only a new url can be set to the property that will cause the browser to load that url. So in this post I will be outlining some basic use case examples of the document.location property.
