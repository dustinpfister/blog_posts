This [javaScript example](/2021/04/02/js-javascript-example/) post will be on a ratio module that I put together that I intend to use with a bunch of other modules to create one or more games that involve the use of ratios. The main project thus far with this is my orb.js module that I have been working on as of late, but I am sure that I might find additional uses for this in future projects.
