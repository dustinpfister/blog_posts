As of revision 125 pf [threejs](https://threejs.org/) The Geometry Constructor has been removed which will result in code breaking changes for a whole Internet of threejs example. So this week I have been editing old posts, and writing some new ones on threejs, and I have noticed that I have not wrote a post on the buffer geometry constructor just yet. I have wrote one on the old Geometry Constructor that I preferred to use in many of my examples, but now that the constructor is no more I am going to need to learn how to just use the Buffer Geometry Constructor when it comes to making my own geometries.
