For today I will be writing another on eof my quick little posts on [lodash](https://lodash.com/), just for the hell of it. My approach with lodash is that when I write a post on a certain lodash method, I am not just writing about lodash, but a certain way to preform a certain task often involving arrays, or array like objects. So under that light I think it is a good idea to write some content on the topic. Anyway todays post will center around the \_.compact method that can be used to quickly remove false values awway from an array. Covering the method by itself is not that involved, but it can branch off into some additional topics when it comes to doing the same with just plain old vanilla js, and there are other lodash methods of interest as well, so lets do this.
