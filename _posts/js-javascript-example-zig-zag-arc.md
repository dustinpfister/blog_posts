When making a javaScript project that is some kind of game or something to that effect I often end u working with percentage values that are in the from of a number between and including zero and one. So I thought I would work out a quick [javaScript example]((https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/javascript-examples.php)) that makes use of some custom utility methods that take a percentage value and return another percentage value that does not go from zero to one in a linear way.
