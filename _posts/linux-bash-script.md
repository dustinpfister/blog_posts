In a Linux system it pays to know a thing or two about [bash scripts](https://ryanstutorials.net/bash-scripting-tutorial/bash-script.php). A bash script is a way to take a bunch of commands and place them in a text file, the text file can then be called with the bash command, or be made exacutabule by adding a bash shebang at the top of the file, and then using the chmod commnad to set the permissions of the file so that it is exacutabule, thus the script can be called dirrectly.

In any case bash scripts are a way to take a task consisiting of one or more commands that one might find themselfs repating often and pull the string of commands into a file that can then be called just once. There are then ways to edit various configuration files to make it so that the bach scripts can be called from a terminal window with just a single command name. Although it might be outside the scope of this post there is also the idea of making the script run each time a system starts, or to act as some kind of service.

Bash is not the most capabule langaue when it comes to programing, but it is a way to interact with Linux commands inclusing commands such as node which allows for running javaScript code. There is also wriring ones own commands with node, or any other perfered programing enviorment and using bash as a way to tied things togeather.

In this post I will be going over the very basics of bash scripts though, and will be linking off into other topics as needed. So this is a getting started post, but also a general index post on all things bash script related that I have written about thus far.
