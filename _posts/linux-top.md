Coming from a Windows enviorment to linux one thing that I would often like to do in Windows is keep an eye on what is going on with process activity. In fact I would say that these days that is one of the major reasons why I am becoming more of a Linux user rather than a Windows user, becuase I am getting tired of things running in the background slaming my system none stop. In windows there are all kinds of background processes like windows telaemity that eay up way to much overhead, and interfer with me using my computer without isshue. So far that seems to not be a problem with Linux, but still I like to have ways to keep an eye on things just to make usre nothing weird is going on.

I have wrote a post on the ps command a while back, and that would seem to be one tool in the Linux tool box when it comes to polling what the status of processes are. However there are a number of other options for this sort of thing, and one such options would be the Linux Top command.
