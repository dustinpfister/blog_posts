The lodash _.method method can be used to call a method at a given path when used with another lodash method like _.map, or _.filter. This is one of the lesser known methods in lodash that I do not see myself using often, and if you are scratching your head wondering if this is a feature that makes lodash worth the hassle or not you have come to the right place.
