The lodash \_.method method can be used to call a method at a given path when used with another lodash method like _.map, or _.filter. This is one of the lesser known methods in lodash that I do not see myself using often, and if you are scratching your head wondering if this is a feature that makes lodash worth the hassle or not you have come to the right place.

## 1 - lodash _.method in range example

The _.method method is intended to be used with other lodash methods like \_.map that accept a collection as the first argument and then a second argument that is a function that is to be called for each element in that collection.

```js
let inRange = function(){
    return this.x < 9 && this.x >=0 
}
let points = [
    { pt: { x: -1, tester: inRange } },
    { pt: { x: 5, tester: inRange} },
    { pt: { x: 3, tester: inRange} },
    { pt: { x: 25, tester: inRange} },
];
let f = _.filter(points, _.method('pt.tester'));
let r = _.map(f, function(el){ return el.pt.x})
console.log(r); // [5, 3]
```
