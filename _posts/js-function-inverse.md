I have made an experience point system, and as of late I have been making a few new systems, but I have found that I should maybe take a step back and work on some more basic functions before progressing on to making one or more experience point systems. I say that because I think I need to work out some things when it comes to inverse functions which is a subject that seems to come up when getting into making an experience point system. Simply put when I am making an experience point system I like to have two methods that give me an unknown value when I have a known value.
