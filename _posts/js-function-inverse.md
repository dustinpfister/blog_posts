I have made an [experience point system](/2020/04/27/js-javascript-example-exp-system/), It works okay, but it lacks some additional features that I would like to add. So as of late I have been making a few new systems, but I have found that I should maybe take a step back and work on some more basic functions before progressing on to making one or more experience point systems. I say that because I think I need to work out some things when it comes to [inverse functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_function) which is a subject that seems to come up when getting into making an experience point system, at least speaking from my experience with making experience point systems thus far, not pun intended. 

Simply put when I am making an experience point system I like to have two methods that give me an unknown value when I have a known value.
