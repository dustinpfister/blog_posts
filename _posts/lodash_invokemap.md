So you have a collection in javaScript, and by collection I mean an array or an object in general that is a collection of key value pairs. With that said the situation is that you want to invoke a method in the collections prototype, or any method in general, for all elements in this collection. Well in lodash there is the [invokeMap method](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#invokeMap) that can be used to invoke a method at a certain path, for all elements in a collection. When I say path I mean a string representation of nested property names for an object in a collection, a standard that is used with methods like the [lodash get](/2018/09/24/lodash_get/) method.

However in modern javaScript there are also plenty of tools to grab at to begin with that a javaScript developer should be ware of that can also be used for this kind of task. So lets take an look at some code examples of calling a method for all elements in a collection.

## 1 - Using lodash invoke map with an array to call an array prototype method

So the lodash invoke map method is used by calling the method and then passing the collection as the first argument. The second argument is then a path to a method in the given collection object, or a function to use in place for such a method that is to be called for all elements in the collection. Any additional arguments are then arguments that are to be passed to the method that is to be called.

```js
let arr = [
    [7, 56, 3, 3, 0, 12],
    [6, 5, 4],
    [5, 5, 5, 1]
];
 
let sorter = function (a, b) {
    if (a < b) {
        return -1;
    }
    if (a > b) {
        return 1;
    }
    return 0;
};
 
let r = _.invokeMap(arr, 'sort', sorter);
 
console.log(r);
// [ [ 0, 3, 3, 7, 12, 56 ], [ 4, 5, 6 ], [ 1, 5, 5, 5 ] ]
```

### 1.1 - Doing the same thing with vanilla javaScript using Array.prototype.map

However it is not so hard to do what invoke map does with plain old vanilla javaScript my itself also. For example I can do the same as above with just the native map array prototype method.

```js
let r = arr.map(function (nums) {
        return nums.sort(sorter);
    });
 
console.log(r);
// [ [ 0, 3, 3, 7, 12, 56 ], [ 4, 5, 6 ], [ 1, 5, 5, 5 ] ]
```

## 2 - Okay but lodash invoke map is a collection method so it works out of the box with objects in general too

So it is true that invokeMap is one of the many so called collection methods in lodash. That is it is a method that will not just work with arrays or objects in general but both. So if I have a similar situation as before, but now it is an object with named rather than numbers key values then I can still juts use invokeMap. The only difference now is that because it is a plain old javaScriot object it does not have sort in the prototype object, however I can pass the method as the second argument rather than a string that is a path to the method.

```js
let obj = {
    a: [7, 56, 3, 3, 0, 12],
    b: [6, 5, 4],
    c: [5, 5, 5, 1]
};
 
let sorter = function (a, b) {
    if (a < b) {
        return -1;
    }
    if (a > b) {
        return 1;
    }
    return 0;
};
 
let r = _.invokeMap(obj, Array.prototype.sort, sorter);
 
console.log(r);
// [ [ 0, 3, 3, 7, 12, 56 ], [ 4, 5, 6 ], [ 1, 5, 5, 5 ] ]
```

## 2.1 - However it is not that much harder to do so with vanilla javaScript, just need to use Object.values

However it is not always so hard to still do the same with just pain old vanilla javaScript.
```js
let r = Object.values(obj).map(function (nums) {
        return nums.sort(sorter);
    });
console.log(r);
// [ [ 0, 3, 3, 7, 12, 56 ], [ 4, 5, 6 ], [ 1, 5, 5, 5 ] ]
```

## 3 - Conclusion

I am not the kind of developer that things that lodash is just filled with methods like invokeMap. There are many talking points as to why it is that lodash is more than just a collection of methods that I may or may not use in a project. Even if you do not use lodash it is still a good idea to look at the lodash source code as there is a lot to be learned as to how it is designed. Also there is much more to write about when it comes to why it might be a good idea to use some kind of user space module that is a collection of independent methods in its own global variable rather than monkey patching methods that should be there into native objects.

Still when it comes to invokeMap alone I can not say this is the most compelling method to support a case to use lodash.
