The depth material in [threejs](https://threejs.org/) is a material that shows depth of a mesh object, it s based on the near and far values of a camera and of course the distance of that camera from the mesh. So in this post I thought I would write about a few examples about this kind of material, and in the process of doing so I think I will be touching base on some things that have to do with cameras also.
