If for some reason I want to delete an object property in a vuejs data object, the view might not update when doing so. There is the force update method that can be used to update a view if necessary. However there is the built in [Vue delete](https://vuejs.org/v2/api/#Vue-delete) method as well that can also be used to delete an object property and update the view in one shot.

## 1 - Vue delete with just the javaScript delete keyword

The way to go about deleting an object property with native javaScript is to use the delete keyword. If I really want to I can use that as a way to delete an object key of the data object of a view, but the view will not update to reflect that. However I can use the force update method to update the view afterwards to do so.

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>vue el example</title>
    <script src="/js/vuejs/2.6.10/vue.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
  <ul class="foo">
    <li id="bar" >{{ obj }}</li>
  </ul>
  <script>
  
  var vm = new Vue({
    el:'#bar',
    data: {
        obj: {foo:'bar', baz:'chew'}
    }
  });
  
  // delete will not update the view
  // so force update must be used to
  // render the change
  delete vm.obj.baz
  vm.$forceUpdate();
  
  </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Although a solution like this might work there is the built in vue delete method that can be used to both delete the object key, and update the view in one shot.

## 2 - Vie delete global method

One way to use the delete method is as a global method of Vue. As such the same example above could also be written as such:

```js
  
  var vm = new Vue({
    el:'#bar',
    data: {
        obj: {foo:'bar', baz:'chew'}
    }
  });
  
  // The Vue delete global method can be used to
  // delete an object key and update the view
  Vue.delete(vm.obj, 'baz');
```
