This week I made another major [JavaScript example](/2021/04/02/js-javascript-example/) this time it is a current standard game framework. This project is actually me using a whole bunch of different projects that I have made over time to create one massive central project of a javaScript example. The thing about this here is that I am getting tired of writing the same code over and over again each time I start a new project, which is often going to be the case when it comes to making the project a vanilla javaScript project. After all that term means I am writing all the code from the ground up rather than using some popular framework. So if I am getting tired of writing everything all over again each time I start a new project, but I do not want to use someone else framework, then I guess I just have to make my own.
