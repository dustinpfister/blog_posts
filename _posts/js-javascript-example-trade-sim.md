Today I would like to work out another simple [javaScript example](/2021/04/02/js-javascript-example/), this time I wanted to start a very simple trade simulator example. Nothing major as I like to just work out simple basic examples of things when it comes to many of these javaScript examples, that I may, or may not continue to work on when it comes to truing it into something that I might use in a real project of some kind.
