So I finally got around to making my first [phaser ce](https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser-ce/index.html) plug in, and now I am wishing that I look into how to go about doing this sooner. Although I have not been writing about it yet, I have bean working on a few prototypes for actual games, rather than simple little examples that just show how to work with one little thing in phaser ce. As such I am ruing into issues when it comes to how to go about keeping things well organized as a project grows in size. So far it looks like making plug-ins might be a better way of keeping things well structured compared to other options. So in this post I will me writing about how to make a basic plug-in, and also some slightly more complex examples as well.
