Looking back I have wrote a few posts on promises in nodejs, and a few when it comes to using them in javaScript in general. However I have not yet wrote a main post on node promise topics in general. From just starting out with the Promise constructor, and the using the promisify utility method to convert old callback style methods to methods that return promises.

It would also be nice to have one post where I go beyond just the basics of promises, and give some real solid examples that outline why they are great for handing a whole bunch of async tasks.
