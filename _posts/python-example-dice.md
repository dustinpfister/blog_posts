I would like to start off a few posts on some basic, and maybe a few not so basic python applaction examples. Just for the sake of learning how to progress beyond just picking up the basics when it comes to the langue itself, and the standard libries. After all the long term plan of picking up a langue should be to create some actual projects of one kind or another.

I think at least a few posts should be on very basic single file programes that just do one little thing. This is becuase I would like to have a few very simple getting started type posts where the goal is to make something that is a finished product rather than just soemthing that helps with one little problem. However I also think that often that should be the goal anyway when it comes to making a python applaction. Often I might think of an applaction as just one product, but often one product can be just a whole bunch of products that work togetaher.
