This is a post on express examples from very basic examples that are just a single file, to more complex projects that use a fair number of npm packages, or a lot of vanilla js code apart from expressjs. There is a lot to know before hand of course, but if you have been playing around with express for a while now and are not looking for some full express app examples of one sort or another on this site this is the right place to be.
