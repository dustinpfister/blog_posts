I want to write a few posts on express examples that are actual full working application examples, rather than just simple hello world type examples. There is of course the typical todo app that is often the case, but I want to make a few more that go beyond that into other examples as well. As of late I have been transitioning from using windows to linux, and so far have been having a hard time finding a text editor that stacks up to notepad++ which I have grown accustomed to in windows. So why not make my own text editor on top of node.js, and express that I can take with me to any operating system that I can get node.js installed on? Sounds like a good idea to me compared to being dependent on a windows exclusive app, so I put together a quick basic expressjs powered text editor example.
