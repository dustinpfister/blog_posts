Sometimes when working on a javaScript project there is a need to create a range of numbers in an array, with [lodash](https://lodash.com/) there is the [\_.range](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.10#range) method than can be used to quickly make a range of numbers. The method is fairly easy to use so this should be a thin post today, but to help beef things up here many I will cover some vanilla js solutions for this as well.

## 1 - what to know

This is a post on the \_.range method in lodash that can be used to quickly create an array that contains a range of numbers. This is also something that is not that hard to do with plain old vanilla js as well, so I will also be looking at some plain old javaScript solutions for this as well. This is not a getting started post with lodash, or javaScript in general, so I hope you have at least some background with this.
