In many game projects there is a need to create a grid, either as part of the games mechanics, as a way to dimension space, or as a way to quickly have some way to show that a sprite is moving my having at least some kind of background other than a solid color. In [Phaser ce](https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser-ce/) there is a way to quickly make a grid texture with create.grid, but this might not be the best option for some cases. In any case in this post I will revive a quick simple demo of how to use create.grid, and some pother alternatives as well.
