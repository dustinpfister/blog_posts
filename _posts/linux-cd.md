The linux cd command is what is used to change the current working directory when working in a terminal. To know the current working directory there is also the pwd command. This is one of the first commands to become aware of when laerning bash for the first time, however there are still a few things to cover when it comes to using it. For example there is how to go about changing to a folder that has spaces in the name, and also how to quikly jump the the home folder of the current user. Still this should prove to be a fairly quick basic post though.
