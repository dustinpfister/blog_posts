I would like to write at least a few posts on examples of a Stochastic process when it comes to statostics. When it comes to any collection of content on something there is always a kind of getting started type post when it comes to just working out the very basics of something. So a Bernoulli Stochastic process would be a good starting point when it comes to this kind of process becuase such a process is just simply a coin toss, or in order words a random process where there are only two possible outcomes.
