In [express.js](https://expressjs.com/) there are a number of options for view engines, or template languages. I am somewhat partial to ejs, but another popular option is pug. I have all ready wrote a post on using the pug node.js npm package by itself, but in this post I will be writing on setting up pug in express.js so it can be used with the render response method.
