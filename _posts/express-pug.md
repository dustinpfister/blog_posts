In [express.js](https://expressjs.com/) there are a number of options for view engines, or template languages. I am somewhat partial to ejs, but another popular option is [pug](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html). I have all ready wrote a post on using the [pug node.js npm package](/2017/12/05/nodejs-pug-getting-started/) by itself, but in this post I will be writing on setting up pug in express.js so it can be used with the render response method.
