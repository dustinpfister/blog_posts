So with [lodash](https://lodash.com/) as well as with plain old vanilla js there are the methods \_.join in lodash, and Array.join when it comes to native javaScript. In any case this is a method that come sup a lot when working out all kinds of solutions for problems when working in a javaScript programing environment. These methods are used to join all the elements of an array together with a given separator furnishing a string from those array elements. It can be thought of as the opposite of \_.split, or String.split that can be used to split a string down into an array of elements with a given separator. In any case this post will outline some examples of joining the elements of a javaScript array togeather into a string.

## 1 - what to know

This is a post on the lodash method \_.join, as well as the corresponding Array.join methods that are used in javaScript to join an array of elements together into an array. It is not a getting started post on lodash, or javaScript in general, and I assume that you have at least a little background with javaScript before hand.
