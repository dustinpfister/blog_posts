So with [lodash](https://lodash.com/) as well as with plain old vanilla js there are the methods \_.join in lodash, and Array.join when it comes to native javaScript. In any case this is a method that come sup a lot when working out all kinds of solutions for problems when working in a javaScript programing environment. These methods are used to join all the elements of an array together with a given separator furnishing a string from those array elements. It can be thought of as the opposite of \_.split, or String.split that can be used to split a string down into an array of elements with a given separator. In any case this post will outline some examples of joining the elements of a javaScript array togeather into a string.
