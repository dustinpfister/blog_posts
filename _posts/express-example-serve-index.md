When working out a nodejs project it would be nice to have a way to just quickly create something that will just serve an index of a public html folder and that is it. I could take the time to work out my own solution when it comes to that, but even simple things like this can often prove to be a little time consuming. If I am willing to make [expressjs](https://expressjs.com/) part of the stack, and often that is one npm package that I do not mide using, then there is a middleware for express called serve index that can make quick work of this kind of task.
