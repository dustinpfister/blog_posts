Lately I have been giving my turret defense canvas example a much needed overhaul as I do not like the state that I have it in. I added a whole bunch of code that brings things to the example that start to make it look like an actual game to some extent for once. However there is much more work to do when it comes to making a quality game that people might actually want to play. For today though I wanted to work out a simple javaScript example where I am just focusing one one little aspect of the game, and that is just having the turret move and fire.
