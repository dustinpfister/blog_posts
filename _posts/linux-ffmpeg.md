The ffmpeg command can be used to create videos from a collection of frames, as well as a wide range of other tasks such as creating a new collection of frames with one or more filters applied to scale, crop, and noise and much more. So when it comes to just about anything video related in Linux this is the default goto solution for editing video from the command line. There are a lot of other great programs to work with in Linux to edit video though, such as OpenShot which is one of my favorite options thus far. However often a great many of these video editing programs are for the most part just graphical front ends for ffmpeg.
