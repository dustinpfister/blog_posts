Baked into threejs there are a number of [Math utilities](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/math/MathUtils) that can be  used to help with various tasks such as clamping values. Othe things that can be done with the various methods include things such as converting a degree value to a radian value, or getting random values and pseudo random values. 
However there is not just thinking in terms of what there is to work with, but also what is missing when it comes to a collection of methods such as this. With that said I think I should also write about one or more additional things that are not in this math utils object, but should maybe be there. Even though there are some usual suspect type methods to work with here I can not say that this is a replacement for some kind of additional utility library.

## The math utils method and what to know first

This is a post on some of the features of the Math utils method in the javaScript library known as threejs. I am assuming that you have all ready got up to speed with the basics when it comes to [getting started with threejs](/2018/04/04/threejs-getting-started/), and also have at least some background when it comes to client side web programing to begin with.

### Version Numbers matter

When  I first wrote this post I was using r135 of threejs with was still a fairly late version of threejs at the time. Always check what version you are using when reproducing things on you end as code breaking changes are made to threejs often.

### Source code example in this post are on Github

The source code examples that I am writing about in this post [are up on Github](https://github.com/dustinpfister/test_threejs/tree/master/views/forpost/threejs-math-utils).

## 1 - Basic example of threejs math utilities using degree to radian method when setting the position of a mesh

Maybe one of the methods that I find myself using the most often would be the degree to radians conversion method that there is to work with in this Object. Although it is not so hard to just do this with a simple expression because it is a such a common task of course there is a method for this in the Math utils method. 

The use of radians comes up a whole lot and not just with javaScript related features but with various core javaScript features as well such as the Math cos and sin methods. With that said that is what I am using the methods for in this example actually by converting a given degree value to a radian value and then using that to get the desired x and y values that will be use to set the position of a mesh object.

```js
(function () {
    // SCENE TYPE OBJECT, CAMERA TYPE OBJECT, and RENDERER
    var scene = new THREE.Scene();
    scene.add(new THREE.GridHelper(10, 10));
    var camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(50, 4 / 3, 0.1, 20);
    scene.add(camera);
    var renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer();
    renderer.setSize(640, 480);
    document.getElementById('demo').appendChild(renderer.domElement);
    // adding a mesh object
    var mesh = new THREE.Mesh(
            new THREE.BoxGeometry(1, 1, 1),
            new THREE.MeshNormalMaterial());
    scene.add(mesh);
    // SETTING POSITION OF THE MESH OBJECT
    var radian = THREE.MathUtils.degToRad(20);
    var x = Math.cos(radian) * 5,
    z = Math.sin(radian) * 5;
    mesh.position.set(x, 0, z);
    camera.position.set(8, 8, 8);
    camera.lookAt( 0, 0, 0 );
    // render static scene
    renderer.render(scene, camera);
}
    ());
```

## 2 - The clamp and rand float methods

One thing that seems to come up a lot with threejs, and many javaScript projects in general actually is the subject of [clamping and wrapping values](/2018/07/22/phaser-math-wrap-and-clamp/). With that said here in threejs there is a clamp method that will clamp a given value to a given range that is all given by way of function arguments. On top of that there is also the subject of [random numbers in javaScript](/2020/04/21/js-math-random/) also, and with that said there is also a number of methods in this math utils object that have to dow with that also. So in this example I am also using the rand float method of the math utils to get random numbers in a range, and then using the clamp method to make sure that when using these values to set the position of mesh objects they say in a given area.

```js
(function () {
    // SCENE TYPE OBJECT, CAMERA TYPE OBJECT, and RENDERER
    var scene = new THREE.Scene();
    scene.add(new THREE.GridHelper(10, 10));
    var camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(50, 4 / 3, 0.1, 20);
    scene.add(camera);
    var renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer();
    renderer.setSize(640, 480);
    document.getElementById('demo').appendChild(renderer.domElement);
 
    // USING THE RANDFLOAT and CLAMP METHODs
    var i = 0,
    len = 30;
    while(i < len){
        var mesh = new THREE.Mesh(
            new THREE.BoxGeometry(1, 1, 1),
            new THREE.MeshNormalMaterial());
        scene.add(mesh);
        var x = THREE.MathUtils.randFloat(-7, 7);
        x = THREE.MathUtils.clamp(x, -4.5, 4.5);
        var z = THREE.MathUtils.randFloat(-100, 100);
        z = THREE.MathUtils.clamp(z, -4.5, 4.5);
        mesh.position.set(x, 0, z)
        i += 1;
    }
    camera.position.set(8, 8, 8);
    camera.lookAt( 0, 0, 0 );
    // render static scene
    renderer.render(scene, camera);
}
    ());
```

## 3 - Euclidean Modulo

As I have mentioned in the clamp example there is not just clamping, but also wrapping number values. In this example I am again doing more or less the same thing as in the clamp example, but now I am using the Euclidean Modulo method to wrap numbers rather than clamping them. 

A long time ago I wrote a post on the subject of [what is wrong with the modulo operator](/2017/09/02/js-whats-wrong-with-modulo/) in core javaScript syntax. The main thing about modulo in javaScript is that it is not that there is something wrong with the modulo operator, it is just that it goes by a process that is a little difference from hat some ming have grown accustom to in other programing languages. So then there is becoming aware of what Euclidean Modulo is compared to what is used in javaScript and how this is what most might expect modulo to work with negative numbers.

```js
(function () {
    // SCENE TYPE OBJECT, CAMERA TYPE OBJECT, and RENDERER
    var scene = new THREE.Scene();
    scene.add(new THREE.GridHelper(10, 10));
    var camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(50, 4 / 3, 0.1, 20);
    scene.add(camera);
    var renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer();
    renderer.setSize(640, 480);
    document.getElementById('demo').appendChild(renderer.domElement);
 
    // USING THE RANDFLOAT and euclideanModulo METHODs
    var i = 0,
    len = 30;
    while(i < len){
        var mesh = new THREE.Mesh(
            new THREE.BoxGeometry(1, 1, 1),
            new THREE.MeshNormalMaterial());
        scene.add(mesh);
        var x = THREE.MathUtils.randFloat(-7, 7);
        x = -4.5 + THREE.MathUtils.euclideanModulo(x, 9);
        var z = THREE.MathUtils.randFloat(-100, 100);
        z = -4.5 + THREE.MathUtils.euclideanModulo(z, 9);
        mesh.position.set(x, 0, z)
        i += 1;
    }
    camera.position.set(8, 8, 8);
    camera.lookAt( 0, 0, 0 );
    // render static scene
    renderer.render(scene, camera);
}
    ());
```

## 4 - The seeded random method

There is using the plain old Math random method and also many other methods that are based off of it. However all of these options are not deterministic in nature, that is that when called they will not give the same numbers each time. In other words some times I might want to have some kind of solution where I have random numbers in a range, but each time I reload the page I get the same set of random numbers. So then they are not really random, but predictable, yet they look kind of random if that makes any sense.

```js
(function () {
    // SCENE TYPE OBJECT, CAMERA TYPE OBJECT, and RENDERER
    var scene = new THREE.Scene();
    scene.add(new THREE.GridHelper(10, 10));
    var camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(50, 4 / 3, 0.1, 20);
    scene.add(camera);
    var renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer();
    renderer.setSize(640, 480);
    document.getElementById('demo').appendChild(renderer.domElement);
    // USING THE SEEDED RANDOM
    var i = 0,
    len = 5;
    while(i < len){
        var mesh = new THREE.Mesh(
            new THREE.BoxGeometry(1, 1, 1),
            new THREE.MeshNormalMaterial());
        scene.add(mesh);
        var x = -5 + THREE.MathUtils.seededRandom() * 10;
        var z = -5 + THREE.MathUtils.seededRandom() * 10;
        mesh.position.set(x, 0, z);
        i += 1;
    }
    camera.position.set(8, 8, 8);
    camera.lookAt( 0, 0, 0 );
    // render static scene
    renderer.render(scene, camera);
}
    ());
```

## 5 - Conclusion

The math utils method then have a whole bunch of useful methods that I find myself using often, however it does not have everything that I might expect to have in such a collection of methods. Although I guess I should not expect everything to be there actually because there is still what there is to work with in the core javaScript math object also of course. Also some of the things that come to mind are methids that I can not say that I use all that often such as an [nth root method](/2020/03/11/js-nth-root/) for example.
