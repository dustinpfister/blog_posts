I have been neglecting my content on threejs, so I thought it would be a good idea to put an end to that by writing some new content on threejs this week, and edit a few posts while I am at it. I have all ready wrote a bunch of posts on the very basics of threejs and although there might sill be more for me to learn about the library itself I think I am at a point now where I should start working on some actaul examples using threejs. So to start off this week I thought I would at least start an example that is another way of displaying the basic idea of my Mr Sun game that I have been working on and off for a while.
