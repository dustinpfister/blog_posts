I have been neglecting my content on threejs, so I thought it would be a good idea to put an end to that by writing some new content on threejs this week, and edit a few posts while I am at it. I have all ready wrote a bunch of posts on the very basics of threejs and although there might sill be more for me to learn about the library itself I think I am at a point now where I should start working on some actaul examples using threejs. So to start off this week I thought I would at least start an example that is another way of displaying the basic idea of my Mr Sun game that I have been working on and off for a while.

The basic idea of my Mr Sun game is to have a display object that repersents a sun, and then a bunch of land sections surrounding the sun. It is then possible to move the sun object around and by doing so that effects the surrounding land section objects. There is then all kinds of other ideas that branch off from there and I have many projects that are just that. Still the basic idea is simple enough and I think it would not be so hard to make a basic threejs example that is another way to go about creating that basic idea at least.
