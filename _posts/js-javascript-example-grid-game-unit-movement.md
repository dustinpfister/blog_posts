So this week I started working on a new canvas example prototype, and the very first minor release of the prototype thus far strikes me as something good to write about as a simple stand alone javaScript example. 

The basic idea that I have together thus far with it could be taken in a whole range of different directions when it comes to making it into something that is more of a game beyond that of what I have in mind for the canvas example prototype. So I thoght I would copy and past the source code over to another location and maintain it as just a simple starting point for a grid tyoe game that involves moving a unit around one or more grids.
