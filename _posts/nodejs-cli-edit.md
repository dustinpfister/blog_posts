So when it comes to developing a node cli tool that is a text editor of sorts there are two general ideas that come to mind. One idea is a text editor that is terminal based in which I am using ansi escape codes to make a text editor like that of nano or vim. The other idea is a text editor that works in a browser window, and I am using nodejs as a way to serve a client system that is that editor, and also have some back end code that is used to save the file I am working on.
