So when it comes to [developing a node cli tool](/2019/10/23/node-cli/) that is a text editor of sorts there are two general ideas that come to mind. One idea is a text editor that is terminal based in which I am using [ansi escape codes](/2019/09/19/nodejs-ansi-escpe-codes) to make a text editor like that of nano or vim. The other idea is a text editor that works in a browser window, and I am using nodejs as a way to serve a client system that is that editor, and also have some back end code that is used to save the file I am working on.

## 1 - This is not a getting started post on node cli tools

This post is on a text editor i made for my [node_cli_tools project](https://github.com/dustinpfister/node_cli_tools). The editor that I am writing about here makes use of many resources that are part of the core repository of the project. So it might be a good idea to start with [my post on the node_cli_tools project in general](/2019/10/23/node-cli). If not you might have a hard time trying to reproduce what I am writing about here.

## 2 - The edit/index and edit/command/default script of the nc-edit node cli tool

So in the main root directory of my node_cli_tools project I have a bin folder, and in this bin folder I have the edit folder that composes everything that is my nc-edit command. At the root of the edit folder is an index.js file that is what will be called within the project when i call the nc-edit command in the command line interface. One of the resources that I am uses is called [yargs](/2018/07/24/nodejs-yargs) which is an option parser which is used in the main index.js file, to which I then load one or more commands for the nc-edit command in the commands folder that is also in the edit folder. In this section I will be quickly going over the index.js file and the default.js file in the commands folder.


### 2.1 - edit/index.js and package.json of node_cli_tools

The index.js file is where I am using yargs for option parsing, and I am just loading in one default command for the nc-edit command as of this writing. The logic for the default command is in the default.js file in the command folder, a common folder for all commands in this project.

```js
#!/usr/bin/env node
// main index.js for nc-edit
// using yargs for option parsing sub commands in a ./commands folder
require('yargs')
.command(require('./commands/default.js'))
.argv;
```

This file of course makes use of the nodejs shebang because it is the script that will first be called when calling the nc-edit command, and this is for course the entry point that I have defined in the bin key of the package.json file in the root of the node_cli_tools project folder.

```js
  "bin": {
    "nc-init": "bin/init/index.js",
    "nc-walk": "bin/walk/index.js",
    "nc-ssg": "bin/ssg/index.js",
    "nc-edit": "bin/edit/index.js"
  }
```

### 2.2 - /edit/commands/default.js

Here I have the logic for the single default command for nc-edit that sets up a server for a port and target folder that contains files that are to be edited. The module defines an object that will be used with yargs in the main index.js file. In loads the server.js file in the edit folder that will set up the server that will host the client system that will be used to edit files in a browser window.

```js
// default command for nc-edit
let server = require('./server.js'),
path = require('path');
 
exports.command = '*';
exports.aliases = ['d'];
exports.describe = 'default command';
 
exports.builder = {
    // target project folder
    t: {
        default: process.cwd()
    },
    // port to host
    p: {
        default: 8080
    }
};
exports.handler = function (argv) {
    console.log('nc-edit default command:');
    
    server({
        target: argv.t,
        port: argv.p,
        dir_public: path.join(__dirname, 'public'),
        dir_shared_public: path.join(__dirname, '../../../shared/public')
    })
    
};

```

## 3 - The server.js file

This is the main server.js file it is what will start when the default command is used. The port and target folder can be set in the command line when starting the command, but much of the other properties of a main conf object are internal. I am using express as a server side framework, because I have found that it saves me a great deal of time compared to working out a backend system without a framework such as express.

```js
// nc-edit default command sever
let express = require('express'),
path = require('path');
 
module.exports = (conf) => {
    
    let app = express();
    
    conf = conf || {};
    conf.port = conf.port || 8080;
    conf.target = conf.target || process.cwd();
    conf.dir_public = conf.dir_public || path.join(__dirname, 'public');
    conf.dir_shared_public = conf.dir_shared_public || path.join(__dirname, '../../../shared/public');
    conf.app = app;
 
    app.use('/', express.static( conf.dir_public ));
    app.use('/shared', express.static( path.join(conf.dir_shared_public) ));
    
    app.use('/file-list', require(path.join(__dirname, 'middleware/file-list.js'))(conf) );
    app.use('/file-open', require(path.join(__dirname, 'middleware/file-open.js'))(conf) );
    app.use('/file-save', require(path.join(__dirname, 'middleware/file-save.js'))(conf) );
    
    app.listen(conf.port, () => {
        
        console.log('nc-edit server running on port ' + conf.port);
        
    });
    
    
};
```

The main method that is exported and called in default.js creates some static paths for the client system in a public folder that is also contained with the commands folder of the edit folder, more on that latter. In additional a public static folder that is local to the nc-edit command I also have a public folder in a main shared folder at the root of the node_cli_tools project folder. In that folder I am making use of additional resources that are used in the client system, mainly vuejs, and vue-resource as an http client.

I also make use of several middileware modules for this project that preform the actions of opening and writing files in the target folder.

## 3 - the /edit/commands/middleware files

In this section I will be going over the server [express middileware](/2018/06/25/express-middleware/) methods that I have put together for this project.

### 3.1 - file-open

This middleware opens a current file, and then sends back the contents of that file.

```js
// open a file
let express = require('express'),
fs = require('fs'),
path = require('path');
module.exports = (conf) => {
    let router = express.Router();
    router.use(require('body-parser').json());
    router.post('/', (req, res) => {
        fs.readFile(path.join(conf.target, req.body.fileName), 'utf8', (e, text) => {
            if (text) {
                res.json({
                    mess: 'looks like we have some text',
                    text: text,
                    fileName: req.body.fileName
                });
            } else 
                res.json({
                    mess: e.message,
                    text: '',
                    fileName: req.body.fileName
                });
            }
        });
    });
    return router;
};

```

### 3.2 - file-save

This middleware writes the contents that have been submitted from the client system to the file in the target folder.

```js
// save a file
let express = require('express'),
fs = require('fs'),
path = require('path');
module.exports = (conf) => {
    let router = express.Router();
    router.use(require('body-parser').json());
    router.post('/', (req, res) => {
        fs.writeFile(path.join(conf.target, req.body.fileName), req.body.text, 'utf8', (e) => {
            if (e) {
                res.json({
                    mess: e.message,
                    fail: true,
                    fileName: req.body.fileName
                });
            } else {
                res.json({
                    mess: 'save is good',
                    fail: false,
                    fileName: req.body.fileName
                });
            }
        });
    });
    return router;
};

```

## 4 - the edit/commands/public folder

This section is on the public folder of the edit folder for the nc-edit command. This contains and index.html file that is the single page of the editor, and a client.js file that is the javaScript logic for the client system.

### 4.1 - index.html

Here I have the main index.html file that has a div element that will server as a mount point for my vuejs vue that is defined in the client.js file. I am slo of course linking to that client.js file, but first I am loading some resource that are used by the client system mainly vuejs and vue-resource.

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>nc-edit</title>
 
    <style>
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    
    <h1>nc-edit</h1>
    <br>
 
    <div id="editor">
    </div>
    
    <script src="/shared/js/vuejs/2.6.10/vue.min.js"></script>
    <script src="/shared/js/vue-resource/1.5.1/vue-resource.min.js"></script>
    <script src="/js/client.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

### 4.2 - client.js

```js
var vue = new Vue({
        // attaching to editor hard coded html element
        el: '#editor',
        // temaple for the vue
        template: '<div>' +
        '<input type=\"text\" v-model=\"fileName\"> ' +
        '<input type=\"button\" value=\"open\" v-on:click=\"open\"> ' +
        '<input type=\"button\" value=\"save\" v-on:click=\"save\"> <br><br>' +
        '<textarea cols=\"80\" rows=\"20\" v-model=\"text\"></textarea>' +
        '</div>',
        // state
        data: {
            fileName: 'untitled.md',
            text: ''
        },
        // methods
        methods: {
            // save a file from text area to target folder
            save: function () {
                console.log('save' + this.$data.fileName);
                this.$http.post('/file-save', {
                    fileName: this.$data.fileName,
                    text: this.$data.text
                })
                .then(function (res) {
                    console.log(res);
                });
            },
            // open a file from target folder of the current fileName
            open: function () {
                console.log('open: ' + this.$data.fileName);
                this.$http.post('/file-open', {
                    fileName: this.$data.fileName
                })
                .then(function (res) {
                    console.log(res);
                    if (res.body.text) {
                        this.$data.text = res.body.text;
                    }
                })
            }
        }
    });

```
