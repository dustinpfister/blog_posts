The Browser Window class is one of the first Classes in Electron.js that one will want to work with. It is possible to have an electron app without using it, but chances are I am going to want to have at least one if not more windows to work with, and to do so I will want to use this class. There is also one other class that I think that a developer should be aware of right alway also, which is the Menu class. This Menu class as the name suggests is how to go about creating a custom menu for one or more windows in the application.
