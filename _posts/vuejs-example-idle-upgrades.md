Today I am continuing with making a basic idle game useing vuejs as a framework. In the last two posts on this subject I started out with a very basic example that I just manual production or resources, and selling those reasources for money. In yesterdays post I work out the very basics of over time production or resources, and at this post I also have a single save state working. There is just one more very basic feature that an idle game should have before moving on to more advanced topics that might help to turn this into soemthing interesting, and that is having some kind of system for upgrades.

The topic of upgrades alone can quickly turn into a major habit hole if I let it do so, but for this example I just want to work out a simple system and move on.
