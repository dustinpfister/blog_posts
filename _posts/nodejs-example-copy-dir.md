This node example post of mine will be on some javaScript code I put together for copying a directory. This might not be the best solution for all projects, but I am using some code to this effect in a project I am working on. There are many other options out there on the web, many of which are packed with features that I will not use, I do not want, or I think should be pulled into another library. However in some respects they might also be a bit more robust compared to what I have worked out here.
