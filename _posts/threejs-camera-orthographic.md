In [three.js](https://threejs.org/) there are a few cameras to work with, typically in must cases I would use the perspective camera, however there is also the orthographic camera as well that can come in handy. In this post I will be writing about the orthographic camera, how it compares to the perspective camera, and why you might want to use it with certain projects.
