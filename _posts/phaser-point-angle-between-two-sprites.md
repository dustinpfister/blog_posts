In this point on [Phaser ce](https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser-ce/), I will be writing about finding the angle between two sprites using the Point class. looking over my content on phaser so far I am surprised that I do not have any content on the point class, so lets put and end to that with one of the most useful methods that is at the ready in that class.

## 1 - What to know before continuing.

This is a post on the html 5 game framework know as [phaser](https://phaser.io/), and how to find the angle between two sprites using a method in the [Point class](https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser-ce/Phaser.Point.html). In this post I am using phaser ce 2.x, and not the newer phaser 3. I assume that you have at least some background with phaser, and javaScript in general.
