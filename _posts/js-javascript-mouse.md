In client side [javaScript mouse](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MouseEvent) events are a way to get mouse cursor positions as well as the state of one or more mouse buttons. The javaScript mouse events are a collection of several types of events that can be attached to the window object, or just about an html element with a method the [add event listener](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener).

There are three general event type of interest when working something out with mouse events that are [onmousedown](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/GlobalEventHandlers/onmousedown), [onmosemove](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/GlobalEventHandlers/onmousemove), and [onmouseup](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/GlobalEventHandlers/onmouseup). There are other events of interest, but for the most part I only bother with those three events when working out any kind of user interface that will make use of a mouse if present.

    out.innerText = 'pos: (' + state.x + ',' + state.y + ' ); down: ' + state.down + ';';

window.addEventListener('mousedown', function (e) {
    state.down = true;

window.addEventListener('mousemove', function (e) {
    setPos(state, e);
