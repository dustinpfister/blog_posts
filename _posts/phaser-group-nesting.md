For the past few days I have been experimenting with [Groups](https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser-ce/Phaser.Group.html) in [Phaser ce](https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser-ce/). Today I worked out some examples that have to do with nesting groups. In other words a group is also a kind of display object, just like that of a Sprite, so another group can be added to a group, along with other display objects. So in this post I will be covering some examples of nesting groups inside of groups, from simple hello world examples, to some that are starting to resemble a game.
