I still have some more writing when it comes to all the various little methods and classes to worth with in three.js, but I am getting to the point where it is time to start thinking in terms of some actual projects of some kind, so I started  writing some posts about basic threejs project examples. Today I think I will write about another basic project idea and this time it is a simple module for creating a group that contains one Mesh that is a sphere, and then another groups that is a collection of groups that contain a mesh that will be positioned and rotated so that the child of the group is positioned over the surface of the sphere.
