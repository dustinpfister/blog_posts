In phaser the world is where all game display objects are. It is a 2d, well, world in which these display objects can move around by way of player input, or some kind of ai script. In this post I will be writing about some examples in which I am just creating one or more display objects, and then moving around in this world. There are some basic thiongs one should know about such as how to have the camera follow a sprite, which is often desirable for most projects. So this should be a fun post.
