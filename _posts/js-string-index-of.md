The javaScript [string index of](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/indexOf) method was introduced to javaScript a real long time ago. It is one of these javaScript prototype methods that is very safe to use because it was around almost since the beginning as the method works even in versions of Internet explorer as old as version 3.

The string index of method will give an index value of a character in a string from the right to left that is the beginning of another string that is given as the first argument. In the event that at least one instance of the given string is found it will return an index value, in the event that it is not it will return the number negative one.
