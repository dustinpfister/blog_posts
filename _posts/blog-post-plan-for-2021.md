Well yet another year has gone by, and another one is to begin, so it is time to make yet another [blog plan](http://www.getspokal.com/the-practical-guide-to-creating-a-blogging-strategy-that-actually-works/) type post. I started doing this each year starting in 2018, and maybe it is not such a bad idea to continue doing this at least once a year. In fact maybe I should even consider doing it on a monthly bases also, at the begining or end of each month maybe.

## 1 - The canvas examples collection will continue to be the new long term project

Lots of devlopers end up with at least one long term project that they start working on, and then continue working on for months, years, even a heavy chunk of the whole of there lifes. This is often typically a game, or some kind of framework, however for me thus far it has been these blog posts actually. In order to write one or more blog posts on something though I need to worm out at least a few quick code examples on that something I want to write about.

Last year in 2020 I wanted to start a new long term project, and I wanted for it to be something fun. Life is short and I should do whatever it is the I really want to do with programing. So on top of continuing this blog I started, and continued working on my canvas examples collection.

### 1.1 - Improve the quality of older canvas examples

As of this writing I all ready have over 40 canvas examples in the collection, however many of them are in need of a fair amount of work in terms of the quality. So as I continue working on the canvas examples collection I think the focus should shift away from creating additional canvas examples, and twords improving the quality of the examples that I have all ready started. I think I should start at least a few more canvas example this year of course, just not at the rate that I did last year.

### 1.2 - Move at a much slower rate when it comes to new canvas examples

As of this writing I am working on a simple hyper casual style space shooter where I just move around and blast blocks. I started this one in december, and have been working on it a little almost every day for the month. I think I will continue working mainly on this one for at least a little while longer into the begining of the new year at least, but I am not sure that I want to keep working on it long term over all the other examples. There are a few other canvas examples that I manage to put a fair about of time into thus far also, and I would liek to get back to working on each of them.

I wanted to break the pattern of starting a project, workong on it for a few hours, or at most a few days, and then move on to the next thing. I have broke that pattern with some of these canvas examples, witch is a good start, but just simply doing that alone is not enough I have found. This kind of typical pattern is just one habit to break, there are other bad habits that need to stop.

However maybe it is not just about stoping bad habits, but also just starting and continuing good ones. Such as just starting the habit of continuing to work on one or more canvas examples that I I find to be fun, or just simple a little addictive maybe. After all if I find one of my canvas examples boring, or I loose interest in playing after a few minutes, then of course that should end up being the case when other people play one for a while. So if that happens then of course it makes sense to play my own game, and if I find it boring take a moment to change something to make the game not so boring.

However it makes sense to not just add any feature that comes to mind, and it is also a good idea to try to not rush things. Cretaing and maintaing a project at a slow steady rate, making features solid, and only working on features that truly add values to the experence of playing the game.

## 2 - Will continue learning Python

I love canvas, there is so much about canvas realter projects that is fun. However in life not everything is fun and games. Outside of the canvas examples collection there is of course continuing to work on this blog, which is an example of something that I do not really want to do. However I still do it anyway becuase I want to expand outward into other areas outside of game devlopemt, and persue things that might not be all that fun, but might prove to be a more realistic path to take when it comes to getting a job, or making a little money on my own.

At the end of last year I started learning python, something that I have been meaning to start teaching myself, but filany got around to doig before the year was out. This year I think that I should continue learning python, and maybe start out or two additional projects with it. However regardless of what I might do with python in the long run, there is not thing that is certain, there will be more content on it to say the least in the form of additional blog posts.

### 2.1 - More posts on python alone, and the standard libraries

So far I have a getting started post on python that is all ready in decent shape to begin with, and over the course of the year I think that I am only going to continue editing it as I learn more about the basics and beyond with python.

## 3 - Better planing, maybe on a monthly or even weekly basis

## 4 - Conclusion

There is a lot that I aim to do in the next year, things have all ready been shifting a little in terms of where i should be placing my time and energy with this blog. I do now want to let this writing eat up to much of my time as I want to work on some actauly code too, and not just quick simple code examples that I make purly for the sake of having somethiong to write about for a blog post. The canvas example colleciton is a good start whe it comes to having an actaul project, but even with that my attention is divided. So there is much more work to do, nut just when it comes to doign actual work, but when it comes to planing things out better.
