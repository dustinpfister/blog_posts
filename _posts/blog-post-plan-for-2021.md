Well yet another year has gone by, and another one is to begin, so it is time to make yet another [blog plan](http://www.getspokal.com/the-practical-guide-to-creating-a-blogging-strategy-that-actually-works/) type post. I started doing this each year starting in 2018, and maybe it is not such a bad idea to continue doing this at least once a year. In fact maybe I should even consider doing it on a monthly bases also, at the begining or end of each month maybe.

## 1 - The canvas examples collection will continue to be the new long term project

Lots of devlopers end up with at least one long term project that they start working on, and then continue working on for months, years, even a heavy chunk of the whole of there lifes. This is often typically a game, or some kind of framework, however for me thus far it has been these blog posts actually. In order to write one or more blog posts on something though I need to worm out at least a few quick code examples on that something I want to write about.

Last year in 2020 I wanted to start a new long term project, and I wanted for it to be something fun. Life is short and I should do whatever it is the I really want to do with programing. So on top of continuing this blog I started, and continued working on my canvas examples collection.

### 1.1 - Improve the quality of older canvas examples

As of this writing I all ready have over 40 canvas examples in the collection, however many of them are in need of a fair amount of work in terms of the quality. So as I continue working on the canvas examples collection I think the focus should shift away from creating additional canvas examples, and twords improving the quality of the examples that I have all ready started. I think I should start at least a few more canvas example this year of course, just not at the rate that I did last year.

### 1.2 - Move at a much slower rate when it comes to new canvas examples

As of this writing I am working on a simple hyper casual style space shooter where I just move around and blast blocks. I started this one in december, and have been working on it a little almost every day for the month. I think I will continue working mainly on this one for at least a little while longer into the begining of the new year at least, but I am not sure that I want to keep working on it long term over all the other examples. There are a few other canvas examples that I manage to put a fair about of time into thus far also, and I would liek to get back to working on each of them.

I wanted to break the pattern of starting a project, workong on it for a few hours, or at most a few days, and then move on to the next thing. I have broke that pattern with some of these canvas examples, witch is a good start, but just simply doing that alone is not enough I have found. This kind of typical pattern is just one habit to break, there are other bad habits that need to stop.

However maybe it is not just about stoping bad habits, but also just starting and continuing good ones. Such as just starting the habit of continuing to work on one or more canvas examples that I I find to be fun, or just simple a little addictive maybe. If I find one of my canvas examples boring, or I loose interest in playing after a few minutes, then of course that should end up being the case when other people play one for a while.

## 2 - Will continue learning Python

## 3 - Better planing, maybe on a monthly or even weekly basis

## 4 - Conclusion
