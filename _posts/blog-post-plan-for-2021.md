Well yet another year has gone by, and another one is to begin, so it is time to make yet another [blog plan](http://www.getspokal.com/the-practical-guide-to-creating-a-blogging-strategy-that-actually-works/) type post. I started doing this each year starting in 2018, and maybe it is not such a bad idea to continue doing this at least once a year. In fact maybe I should even consider doing it on a monthly bases also, at the begining or end of each month maybe.

In order to write one or more blog posts on something though I need to worm out at least a few quick code examples on that something I want to write about.
