Well yet another year has gone by, and another one is to begin, so it is time to make yet another [blog plan](https://doyouevenblog.com/blog-plan/) type post. I started doing this each year starting in 2018, and maybe it is not such a bad idea to continue doing this at least once a year. In fact maybe I should even consider doing it on a monthly bases also, at the begining or end of each month maybe.

This year I am going to continue with writing new posts pretty often, however this might be the last year that I continue doing so. I just have this general idea in mind that as I start to get up to around a thousand posts or so I should start to focus more on the quality of just a single post a week or so rather than trying to write almost every day. I am starting to get to that point, but I do not think that I have to actually get there first in order to change things up a bit.

Some things will stay the same more or less this year then, but there are at least a few things that I would like to do difefrently this year. I have been at this sense 2017, so it should go without saying that I am interested in continuing this for the long term no matter what. I just think that I should change what that the long term means now and then for this site. There is writing just about every day, but then there is working one something for a week, a month, or even longer, and writing just one long content peice on something that something. I have been writing a lot of posts, but mainly on quick simple code examples, and simple projects that I put togetaher in a few hours or a day or so. I am not sure going in the complate polar opposite direction of that is a good idea, I still want to put my eggs in a few baskets rather than just one still, but maybe going that way a little at least would be nice this year.

## 1 - Of course I will continue writing blog posts


## 2 - The canvas examples collection will continue to be the new long term project

Lots of devlopers end up with at least one long term project that they start working on, and then continue working on for months, years, even a heavy chunk of the whole of there lifes. This is often typically a game, or some kind of framework, however for me thus far it has been these blog posts actually. It is great to have at least something to keep working on a little each and every day, so that each day that goes by that something just keeps growing, and hopfully also improving.

However I would like to have at least one other long term project outside of just writing this content. I can only do so much as one person, but I still have enough time to add on at least one or two more projects like what I have done with these blog posts. However I think that it should be an actual code project, or collection of code projects. Last year I started such a project that I am just calling canvas examples, sorry I am not good at names.

Life is short and I should do whatever it is the I really want to do with programing. So on top of continuing this blog as I have for the past few years I also want to continue working on my canvas examples collection. In fact in time I think I will like to invest more time in that rather than this writing if it comes to that which I hope it does. Writing is great dont get me wrong, but I grow tired of it standing in the way of me inversting the time I would really like to invest working on actual projects.

### 2.1 - Improve the quality of older canvas examples

As of this writing I all ready have over 40 canvas examples in the collection, however many of them are in need of a fair amount of work in terms of the quality. So as I continue working on the canvas examples collection I think the focus should shift away from creating additional canvas examples, and twords improving the quality of the examples that I have all ready started. I think I should start at least a few more canvas example this year of course, just not at the rate that I did last year.

### 2.2 - Move at a much slower rate when it comes to new canvas examples

As of this writing I am working on a simple hyper casual style space shooter where I just move around and blast blocks. I started this one in december, and have been working on it a little almost every day for the month. I think I will continue working mainly on this one for at least a little while longer into the begining of the new year at least, but I am not sure that I want to keep working on it long term over all the other examples. There are a few other canvas examples that I manage to put a fair about of time into thus far also, and I would liek to get back to working on each of them.

I wanted to break the pattern of starting a project, workong on it for a few hours, or at most a few days, and then move on to the next thing. I have broke that pattern with some of these canvas examples, witch is a good start, but just simply doing that alone is not enough I have found. This kind of typical pattern is just one habit to break, there are other bad habits that need to stop.

However maybe it is not just about stoping bad habits, but also just starting and continuing good ones. Such as just starting the habit of continuing to work on one or more canvas examples that I I find to be fun, or just simple a little addictive maybe. After all if I find one of my canvas examples boring, or I loose interest in playing after a few minutes, then of course that should end up being the case when other people play one for a while. So if that happens then of course it makes sense to play my own game, and if I find it boring take a moment to change something to make the game not so boring.

However it makes sense to not just add any feature that comes to mind, and it is also a good idea to try to not rush things. Cretaing and maintaing a project at a slow steady rate, making features solid, and only working on features that truly add values to the experence of playing the game.

## 3 - Will continue learning Python

I love canvas, there is so much about canvas realter projects that is fun. However in life not everything is fun and games. Outside of the canvas examples collection there is of course continuing to work on this blog, which is an example of something that I do not really want to do. However I still do it anyway becuase I want to expand outward into other areas outside of game devlopemt, and persue things that might not be all that fun, but might prove to be a more realistic path to take when it comes to getting a job, or making a little money on my own.

At the end of last year I started learning python, something that I have been meaning to start teaching myself, but filany got around to doig before the year was out. This year I think that I should continue learning python, and maybe start out or two additional projects with it. However regardless of what I might do with python in the long run, there is not thing that is certain, there will be more content on it to say the least in the form of additional blog posts.

### 3.1 - More posts on python alone, and the standard libraries

So far I have a getting started post on python that is all ready in decent shape to begin with, and over the course of the year I think that I am only going to continue editing it as I learn more about the basics and beyond with python. In oreder to get a better idea of how I shoukld go about editing it I am just going to neeed to write more about the basics of pythion. When doing so I will have a better idea of what should and should not go into a getting started post in python.

There is all ready a few posts on python in general, and I will of course keep working on that untill I have a nice set of content on the basic of python itself.

### 3.2 - New Word Count standards with my python content

Becuase I am starting a new collection of content I have a chance to do everything a little different from the very begining. When it comes to older content collections I have had not real minamum standards when it comes to the quality of the content. If I wanted to just write a few hudred words on something and move on I would. However this time around with python I would like to rise the bar a little to begin with. I am so far aiming for a minanum of one thousand words, and as i continue editing I think I would like to make each post close to at least some where in the ball pall park of eightween hundred words.

However there is not just raw word count when it comes to blog post quality. I should also do a better job of proof reading the posts, and make sure that I truly am writing decent content on python. This means fact checking things that I might manage to get wrong, and also just taking a moment to think about how I am converying things.

### 3.3 - Some python examples

After I get a good grasp on the basics of python there will then be the question of where it is that I go from there. So this year I think I should maybe work out a few python example projects in a simular way to that of my canvas examples collection. However maybe this time around I should focus more so on quality rather than quantliyu right away rtaher than later. With python I am not just learning a new lanague, I have an opertunity to do lots of other things diferently.

## 4 - Better planing, maybe on a monthly or even weekly basis

Last but not least I am going to want to try to do a better job of planing things out to beging with. This is something that has been borthing me for a long time. Writing a blog post such as this is a step in the right direction at least, but I think I should do more to draft out what I want to write about for each month, week, day, and maybe even down to the hour if I find that going that nuts actaully makes sense.

## 5 - Conclusion

There is a lot that I aim to do in the next year, things have all ready been shifting a little in terms of where i should be placing my time and energy with this blog. I do now want to let this writing eat up to much of my time as I want to work on some actauly code too, and not just quick simple code examples that I make purly for the sake of having somethiong to write about for a blog post. The canvas example colleciton is a good start whe it comes to having an actaul project, but even with that my attention is divided. So there is much more work to do, nut just when it comes to doign actual work, but when it comes to planing things out better.
