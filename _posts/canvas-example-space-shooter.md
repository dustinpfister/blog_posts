So this post might be the first of several [canvas examples](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial), this one will be on a space shooter game. This is a project that I threw together in just a few hours, so it is not really a complete game at the time of this writing at least. Still I have some fun with this one, and I might get around to putting more time into this one at some point.
