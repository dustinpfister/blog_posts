This is a post on another basic command that I would like to write about real quick called the [Linux date](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/date.1.html) command. As one might suspect this is a command where a string value of the current date and time is spit out into the standard output, however there is also how to go about formatting that output. When it comes to formating the output the same standard is used when it cimes to customizing hoe date and time is displayed in the panel in Raspberry pi OS for example.
