The [vuejs framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vue.js) is a great framework for creating simple single page applactions, and reusable compartmentized compoents for such applactions. I started writing a collection of content on this framework a few years ago now, but I have now come around to editing some of that content and expanding with some new posts on the subject in the process.

Whenever I have an extensive collection of content on a subject I often write at least one post that serves as a major centeral location tyope post from which I branch off into all the other posts on the somject from. I have not yet got around to writing such a post for vuejs, that is until now. There is a lot to take in when it comes to learning vuejs for the first time, there are static templates, render functions, data objects, props objects, mixins, and so forth that make up a single vuejs instance. There is then getting into making components where data from a parent vue instance can be passed to one or more compoents by way of properties and then mutated forms of those values can be passed from a child compoents back to a parent by way of events. Then of course there are all the little vuejs built in directives such as v-bind, v-on, and v-for just to name a few on top of making ones own directves.

So it would make sense to have a lengthly main post on vuejs in which I just breefly touch base on all of these little topics, and then link to posts in which I get into that topic in greater detail.
