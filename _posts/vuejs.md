So this week I think I will be starting a new collection of posts on [vuejs](https://vuejs.org/). When I start a new collection of content I often start out with a getting started post on that collection. So this will be a quick post on [vue starting](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/) out topics. In this post I will be outlining how to set up a quick project that involves using node.js and express to serve up the first of what should be at least a few examples on vuejs.
