The [vuejs framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vue.js) is a great framework for creating simple single page applactions, and reusable compartmentized compoents for such applactions. I started writing a collection of content on this framework a few years ago now, but I have now come around to editing some of that content and expanding with some new posts on the subject in the process.

Whenever I have an extensive collection of content on a subject I often write at least one post that serves as a major centeral location tyope post from which I branch off into all the other posts on the somject from. I have not yet got around to writing such a post for vuejs, that is until now. There is a lot to take in when it comes to learning vuejs for the first time, there are static templates, render functions, data objects, props objects, mixins, and so forth that make up a single vuejs instance. There is then getting into making components where data from a parent vue instance can be passed to one or more compoents by way of properties and then mutated forms of those values can be passed from a child compoents back to a parent by way of events. Then of course there are all the little vuejs built in directives such as v-bind, v-on, and v-for just to name a few on top of making ones own directves.

So it would make sense to have a lengthly main post on vuejs in which I just breefly touch base on all of these little topics, and then link to posts in which I get into that topic in greater detail.

## 1 - [Getting strated with vuejs](/2019/05/05/vuejs-getting-started)

It would make sense to start off a post such as this with the ushual getting started with vuejs type stuff, as well as what to know before hand before getting started with vuejs. It should go without saything that it is required that a solid understanding of html, css, and javaScript should be obtained before hand before getting into using vuejs, or any javaScript framework for that matter. However once that is out of the way then it is just a question of knowing how to set up a project folder, making a late version of vuejs part of the client side stack, and then just working out a few simple hello world type examples just for the sake of getting started.



## 2 - Vuejs Options

When making a vuejs instance, component, or mixin there are a number of options that can be used when creating such things. There are options like the methods option that can be used to define a collection of methods that can eb used in a single instance, a collection of instances, or made into a global set of methods depeding on how the method option is used. So it is a good idea to go about getting a solid understanding of each of these options, and also how and where to use such options when it coems to starting to work on a real project of some kind.
