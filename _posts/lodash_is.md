lodash is a javaScript unitiy library based of another similar library known as underscore. These days much of the functionality in lodash is baked into native javaScript itself, but it is still not a dead library just yet as well. In any case there is much that branches off from lodash, even if you use exclusively use native javaScript methods in place of a lodash equivalents, often there was a time in the past that the native method was not there. Depending on the environment you are developing for you might still want to use lodash as a safety net of sorts. Also even if you do kick lodash to the curb, lodash is still a framework worth studying if you feel compelled to do so.
