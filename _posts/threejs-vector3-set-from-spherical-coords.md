When it comes to working out all kinds of simple hello world type project examples using threejs for the sake of learning the basics of threejs, or just gaining a more solid understanding of the library regardless of experience, the Vector three Class might come up often when doing so. There is a while lot to write about when it comes to this class when it comes to things like normalizing an instance of Vector3, or getting the distance between two instances of a Vector3 object. One this that often want to do when making any kind of project with three.js is to position an object in terms of a spherical set of values in terms of a radius, and then two angles that have to do with coronets similar to that of latitude and longitude.
