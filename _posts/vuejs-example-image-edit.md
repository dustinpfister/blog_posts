It has been a long time sense I wrote a post on vuejs, so I thought I would make a vuejs example post. For this vuejs example the idea of a simple image editor application that will create a json version of the image that I draw with it came to mind. So maybe something like that is in order when it comes to expanding on what can be done with vuejs.
