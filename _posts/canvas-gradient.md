A [Canvas Gradient](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasGradient) can be created in html 5 canvas with two constructors of interest which are [create Linear Gradient](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/createLinearGradient), and [create Radial Gradient](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/createRadialGradient). Once a Gradient object is created it is possible to add color stops to it, once done it can be used as a fill or stroke style in a 2d drawing context.
