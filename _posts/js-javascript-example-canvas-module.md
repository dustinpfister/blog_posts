Many of my projects that I make involve working with canvas elements, and I also like to make vanilla javaScript projects where most if not all of the code is my own. Still I would like to stop making everything all over again each time I start a new project, so in todays [JavaScript example](/2021/04/02/js-javascript-example/) post I will be going over a kind of canvas module that so far works okay for what I want to use such a module for.
