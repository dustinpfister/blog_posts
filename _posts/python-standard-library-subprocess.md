When learning a new programing enviorment one thing that I like to learn how to do is how to go about launching another script, or command complatly in the operating system if I can do so. In nodejs there is the child process module for example that provides methods that can be used to run a command, so there should be such a module in python also then. It would seem that the best option for doing so might be the subprocess librray that contains such methods.
