In yesterdays post I started a very basic idle game that lacks many of the core features that I think just about any idle game should have. The basic example was just manual production of a resource, and selling that resource for money, and that is it. I might get back to imporveing that post, and the coresponding code, but I think that maybe that specific example should say pretty basic with just that first step being the focal point. The next step forward could be a great number of things, but one feature that is needed is havine over time production of a resource rather than just clicking. This is a must have of course, in fact the first idle game example is not really an idle game becuase of the absense of this must have feature, so lets get this one out of the way.
