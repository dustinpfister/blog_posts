Last week I made a cube stack [threejs example](/2021/02/19/threejs-examples/) that was based off of an older example that I made for an old post for the orographic camera. I made a whole lot of improvements to that dusty old example for that post, and not for todays threejs example I thought it would be cool to start another project example that is a grid of these cube stack objects actually.
