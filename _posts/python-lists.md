In [python Lists](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/stdtypes.html#lists) are a mutabule kind of sequence data type. These lists might be somewhat simular to Arrays in javaScript, but with at least a few note worthy diferences such as beging a dense rather than sparce kind of array. Lists are not the only option when it comes to arrays in python there is a standard library called array that might prove to be a better option in some cases. However the thing about lists is that it is a type that is built into python itself, and it is just one kind of sever other kinds of sequence types to work with.

In this post I will be going over the basic of lists, how to create them to beging with, how to add and remove elements from them, and also how to sort them. However in the process of doing so I will also be touching base on sequences in general. For example when it comes to built in functions in python there is the list built in function that can be used to create a list, but there is also the range keywod that can eb used as a way to create another kind of sequence that is not mutabule.
