For today I thought I would write a post on [\_.bind](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.10#bind) in [lodash](https://lodash.com/), and also the concept of binding in general, by also covering the native [Function.bind](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_objects/Function/bind) as well. A while back I did writing a post on call, apply and bind, however in this post I will be mainly writing about bind in an environment where lodash is part of the stack, and as such \_.bind is available.
