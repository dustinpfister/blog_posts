The [vue name](https://vuejs.org/v2/api/#name) option is something that comes into play when getting into vue component design. Depending on how you go about adding a component into vuejs the vue name might not need to be specified in the object that defines the nature of the component. However when  making local components it might be a good idea to set the name in the object, but doing so is optional.
