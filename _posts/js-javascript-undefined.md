In javaScript undefined is a value and keyword that comes up often. The undefined value is the default value for variables that are declared but do not have any value assigned to them other than undefined. When working with functions a value of undefined is what is returned by a function by default unless something else is returned by using the return keyword. There is also the undefined keyword that can be used to intentionally set a variable to undefined, and can also be used in expressions. In this post I will be outlining some examples that point out some things that a javaScript developer should be aware of when it comes to undefined in javaScript.
