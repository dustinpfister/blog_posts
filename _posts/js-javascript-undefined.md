In [javaScript undefined](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/undefined) is a value that comes up often. The undefined value is the default value for variables that are declared but do not have any value assigned to them. When working with functions a value of undefined is what is returned by a function by default unless something else is returned by using the return keyword. There is also the undefined keyword that can be used to intentionally set a variable to undefined, and can also be used in expressions. In this post I will be outlining some examples that point out some things that a javaScript developer should be aware of when it comes to undefined in javaScript.
