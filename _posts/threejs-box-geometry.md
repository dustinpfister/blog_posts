After looking over my old content on [three js](https://threejs.org/) it would seem that I never took a moment to write a post On the Box Geometry Constructor. I guess I thought that I knew what I need to know about it and thus I could move on to more advanced topics, if so maybe that was a mistake. Better late than never though so I thought I would take a moment to work out some examples centered around just using the basic Box Geometry constructor in three.js as a way to create a Geometry to be used with a Mesh in a three.js scene.

This will then be a basic post, or at least it will start out that way, for those of you that have some more experienced with three.js I might get into some more advanced topics towards then end of the post, just for the sake of not letting this post end up being to thin. There is just starting out with a simple moving cube example which is not so hard, but then there is getting into how to go about skinning a cube with textures, and not just simple solid color maps with the basic material in that regard.
