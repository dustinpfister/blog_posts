After looking over my old content on [three js](https://threejs.org/) it would seem that I never took a moment to write a post On the Box Geometry Constructor. I guess I thought that I knew what I need to know about it and thus I could move on to more advanced topics, if so maybe that was a mistake. Better late than never though so I thought I would take a moment to work out some examples centered around just using the basic Box Geometry constructor in three.js as a way to create a Geometry to be used with a Mesh in a three.js scene.
