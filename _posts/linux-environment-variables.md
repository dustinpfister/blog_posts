When taking the time to get a little more into how to work with Linux, and Bash, the topic of [enviorment varaibles](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-set-and-list-environment-variables-in-linux/) will come up from time to time. There is knowing how to at least list them, and set them for starters. However there is also doing a few simple bash comands, and maybe event go so far as to make a programe or two to really know why they are usfule.

In this post I will be starting out with the basics when it comes to enviorment varaibles in Linux. This is just listing what the current variables are, and setting and eleteing such variables.
