In a linux enviorment there is the grep command that is useful for finding text in a file, or a bunch of files in a directory. I have been starting to write a few posts on various commands that often are part of linux, or can be easily added to linux, and grep is certainly one such command that I should write a quick post on becuase I am sure it will come in handy now and then with what I often work on when it comes to lengthly collections of text files.
