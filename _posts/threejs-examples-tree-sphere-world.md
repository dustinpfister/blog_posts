Earlier this week I wrote a post on a simple tree model in three.js, so today I thought I would write a post on another example in which I am using that tree model to create a simple world of sorts with these trees all over it. The idea here is to just have instances of this simple tree model positioned on the surface of a sphere.

## 3 - The tree model

Here I have the source code of the tree sphere model that i will be using in the world module. The state of the source code is not all the different form what I world out for my example on this tree model by itself. It is just that this time around I am writing a whole bunch more code around this as a way to do something more with it.

```js
(function (api) {
 
    // default materials
    var materials_default = {
        sphere: new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({
            color: 0x00ff00,
            emissive: 0x004f00,
            side: THREE.DoubleSide
        }),
        trunk: new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({
            color: 0xffaf00,
            emissive: 0x442200,
            side: THREE.DoubleSide
        })
    };
 
    var createSphere = function (opt, materials) {
        var sphere = new THREE.Mesh(
                new THREE.SphereGeometry(opt.sphereSize, opt.widthSegments, opt.heightSegments),
                materials.sphere);
        var adjust = (opt.trunkLength / 2 + opt.sphereSize * 0.75);
        sphere.position.set(0, 0, adjust * -1);
        return sphere;
    };
 
    var createTrunk = function (opt, materials) {
        var trunk = new THREE.Mesh(
                new THREE.BoxGeometry(opt.trunkSize, opt.trunkLength, opt.trunkSize),
                materials.trunk);
        trunk.position.set(0, 0, 0);
        trunk.rotation.set(1.57, 0, 0);
        return trunk;
    };
 
    // create and return a house
    api.create = function (opt) {
 
        opt = opt || {};
        opt.trunkLength = opt.trunkLength === undefined ? 2 : opt.trunkLength;
        opt.sphereSize = opt.sphereSize === undefined ? 1 : opt.sphereSize;
        opt.trunkSize = opt.trunkSize === undefined ? 0.25 : opt.trunkSize;
        opt.widthSegments = opt.widthSegments === undefined ? 15 : opt.widthSegments;
        opt.heightSegments = opt.heightSegments === undefined ? 15 : opt.heightSegments;
 
        var materials = opt.materials || materials_default;
        var tree = new THREE.Group();
 
        var sphere = createSphere(opt, materials);
        tree.add(sphere);
        var trunk = createTrunk(opt, materials);
        tree.add(trunk);
 
        return tree;
    };
 
}
    (this['TreeSphereMod'] = {}));
```
