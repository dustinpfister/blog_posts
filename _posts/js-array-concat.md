So there is adding two strings or numbers together with the addition operator in javaScript, but then there is adding two or more objects together including arrays. In the array prototype object there is the [array concat](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/concat) method that can be used to create a new array that is the concatenation of two or more arrays, or values.
