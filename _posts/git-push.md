The [git push](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-push) sub command is how to go about updating a remote with local changes. Of course in order to do this to begin with one will need to set up a remote repository to begin with. So with that said there is also knowing at least a thing or two about the [git remote command](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-remote) as a way to find out if any remotes are set up to begin with, and if need be to add one.

Speaking from my experence thus far once a remote is set up, often I can just call the git push command with default options and that will be the end of it. However snese I wrote a [blog post on the git pull command](/2023/05/18/git-pull/), I take it that I should also write about push as well.
