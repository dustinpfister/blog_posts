The lodash values method is one of many methods in lodash where there is a native counterpart. However sometimes browser support for a native method only goes back so far, also sometimes a native method does not always work as expected, or it could use one little additional feature. The lodash values object method might be one such method that supports a case that lodash is not dead just yet. The reason being that the native Object.values method is still fairly new, and as such there is limited browser support for older browsers.
