The javaScript typeof operator will return a string that is the type of the operand that is given to it from the right of the typeof keyword when used. The typeof operator might not always give the desired results, so there are some other keywords, as well as additional properties of objects in javaScript that can be used to gain some insight into what you are dealing with.

The typeof operator has right to level associativity so to use it I just need to type the typeof operator followed by what it is that I want to find the type of.
