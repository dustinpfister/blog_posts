This week I have been working on two projects that are additional game prototypes that might progress into some kind of final product. Today I will be writing on the current state of one of them that I am just calling wild plant grid idle for now. So then this is yet another game prototype idea that I will add to the stack of my simple [JavaScript example](/2021/04/02/js-javascript-example/) projects.

## 1 - The utils module

## 2 - The grid module

## 3 - The grid-plants module

## 4 - game

## 5 - draw

## 6 - main

## 7 - Conclusion

I did not put as much time into this prototype as I would have like to have, mainly because I have been working a lot more on my other prototype that is a game based off of [my orb module that I started a while back](/2021/04/09/js-javascript-example-orb-module/). In fact the current state of the game prototype that I am just calling orb match for now is a kind part of the [project folder for that module](https://github.com/dustinpfister/test_vjs/tree/master/for_post/js-javascript-example-orb-module). At this time I think this project should be shelfs so I can focus better on that project, however in the event that I get burnt out on that one maybe this project would be a good thing to get back into.

At this time I think I am going to need to focus on just one game at a time, and make these blog posts a weekly rather than  daily thing for a while.
