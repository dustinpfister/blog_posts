The [os standard library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html) in python is a library that contains some operating system dependent functionality. There are afew other librarys that come to mind that can also be used as a way to make use of opearting system depedant features. For example the subprocess librray can be used to call a command on the host operating system, but before doing so it helps to know what operating system you are working with first. So the os standard library is a good staring point when it comes to checking out what kind of system my code might be running on top of.
