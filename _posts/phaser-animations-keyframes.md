When making animations for a phaser project, or with animation in general actually the concept of a key frame is important. A key frame can be described as a frame when an animation begins, or ends, and as such it is a beginning state from which an animation will progress from, and then back to in the case of a looping animation. It can also be the two frames at which an animation begins at a starting state, and ends at an ending state when dealing with some kind of non-looping animation sequence. In this post I will be writing about key frames when using the phaser ce game framework, giving some examples of this important animation concept when making sprite sheets for a phaser project.
