Often I end up using [Math.sqrt](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/sqrt) in projects are a way to get the square root of a number, but what if I want the [nth root](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nth_root) of a number? One solution is to use the Math.pow method, and divide 1 by the degree number when working out the exponent for the number that is used as the base for Math.pow.
