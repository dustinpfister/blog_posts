I still want to write at least a few more posts on electronjs, before moving on to focusing on other topics as that just strokes me as the thing to do if I am going to start a new collection of content on something. Anyway when it comes to making an electron application one of many things that comes to mind is how to go about copying something that might be in the clipboard of an operating system into my electronjs application as well as the inversion of doing so. In other ways there must be a way in electron to handle the whole copy and paste thing. With that said there is a clipboard class that can be used as a means to both read and write to the clipboard of the house OS which allows for making use of this common OS feature to transfer some kind of content from one application to another.

## The clipboard class and what to know first

This is then a post on a simple hello world example of the clipboard class in electron.js, that also serves as a basic getting started type example of electron js application in general also when it comes to things like a preload file that I am suing to create a public API that is used in the front end javaScript code.

## 1 - The main javaScript file

```js
```

## 2 - The menu file

```js
```

## 3 - preload

```js
```

## 4 - The index html file

```html
```

## 5 - Conclusion
