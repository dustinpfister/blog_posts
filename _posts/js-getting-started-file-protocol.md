I have wrote a post on getting started with javaScript in general, and another getting started post that is centered on getting started with the javaScript console rather than other ways to get going with javaScript. However I have not yet wrote a post on getting started with javaScript, and using the file protocol. This is strange sense that is how I first started way back in the day for me. Anyway better late then never so I thought I would take a moment to write a post on getting started with javaScript, and using the file protocol, a text editor, and a web browser as a starting point to learn javaScript
