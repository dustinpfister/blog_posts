I want a [canvas example](/2020/03/23/canvas-example/) that will be a simple god game, or a kind of game where things move forward on there own, and there is just a little interaction from the player now and then. I have come to like to play, and make these kinds of games these days. Playing a game can end up eating up a lot of time, so I like games that just move along on there own, and I can just step in and make a few changes now and then. Games like sim city, and roller coster tycoon come to mind when it comes to this.

Anyway the canvas example that I had in mind here is a game where there is this world where there is a sun at the center of a circle, and the rest of the world is along the circumference of this circle. By default the sun starts at the center of this circle world, but the player can move it to any location within this world. The circumference of the outer circle of this world is divided into sections, and each section object has a percentage value, and this percentage value is effected by the distance of the section to the sun object.

There is a lot that comes to mind when it comes to moving forward with this kind of project. but one must start somewhere right? And with that said lets take a look at what I have so far with this one.
