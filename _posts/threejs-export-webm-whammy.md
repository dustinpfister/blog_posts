It has been a few months sense I wrote any new content on [three.js](https://threejs.org/) which is a shame because this project does deserve more attention. Anyway when I am playing around with three.js I often like to use it to make simple looping animations, and it would be nice to have at least one or two ways to export these projects to a reliable webm file format making it easy to share. To help with this I have come across a project called whammy that seems to work okay for the sake of making a webm file on a frame by frame basis. In this post I will be outlineing a simple example of doing just this using three.js, and whammy.
