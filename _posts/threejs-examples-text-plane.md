I am always thinking in terms of what more I can do when it comes to making javaScript modules built on top of threejs that I can use in my various video projects that I make for these blog posts. One such idea is to make an improved way to go about adding text content to a scene object. There are a number of ways of doing so of course, but I was thinking in terms of making a module centered around the idea of having one or more mesh objects that use a plane geometry and canvas textures, and or data textures.

This will then be yet another one of my threejs examples where I am writing about a module or some kind of project that is built on top threejs. This time it will have a lot to do with using canvas elements to create textures, and also a whole lot about working with text content.

## The text Plane threejs module example and what to know first

This is a post in which I am writing about the state of a javaScript module that I made that creates textures from text content using canvas elements that can then be used to skin a plane geometry. This is then a little bot of an advanced project type post in which I am assuming that you all ready have a fair amount of background with threejs and client side javaScript in general.
