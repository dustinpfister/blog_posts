In Linux there is the bash command mkdir that can be used to make a directory, or folder if you prefer in the command line. However theer are also a few more options to write about when it comes to this command alone such as the mkdir -p command that can be used to create nested folders as needed if they are not there. There is also the midir -m options that will allow for me to set what the file access permissions are for the folder. Speaking of permissions there are also maybe a few more things to write about when it comes to other commands that will typically be used in conjunction with mkdir such as chmod as a way to set permissions of folders without the -m option, and contents of files, as well as the ls command to list folders, permissions of folders and the contents of such folders.
