When first starting out with javaScript it is only natural to go threw a faze where a developer needs to become more familiar with how to go about working with arrays in javaScript. There is just simply knowing how to create them for starters, but then there is getting elements from them in a why in which the arrays are mutated in place as well as not doing so. There are many methods of interest when it comes to working with arrays in javaScript, but maybe one of the first methods one will become aware of is the js array pop method that will remove and return the last element in an array. This methods works okay for what it is intended to be used for, however it might not always be the best choice. For example what if it is the first element that is to be removed and returned, and also there is a need to inject elements also of course. So this post will center on the use of the js array pop method, but also other returned methods such as shift and splice.
