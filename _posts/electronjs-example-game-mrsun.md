When it comes to my collection of electronjs examples thus far I do not have an example that is some kind of game project, so I have started one project that is a kind of [Idle Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incremental_game). The game prototype idea is called MrSun, and the general idea is to have a single object that is a sun, and a bunch of objects around the sun that are land sections. The sun can then be moved into other locations in the area between all the land section objects. When doing so the distance from the sun to each land section object will change which will result in temperature changes for each land section.

I have made a whole lot of game prototypes in the past when it comes to my collection of html canvas examples, but this time around with my electionjs examples I would like to focus more so on quality rather than quantity. For this game prototype I have stayed in my lane for the good part of a month, and on top of that I have plans to continue working on this project in a stand alone repository as well. So then this will not just be yet another prototype but a game that I will keep working on, and playing myself, for a little while every day.
