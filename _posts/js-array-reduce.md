This week I am expanding on [javaScript arrays](/2018/12/10/js-array/) a little, and native JavaScript in general a bit, and have found that I have not yet wrote a post on the native [Array reduce](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reduce) method. I have got around to writing a post on the [lodash reduce](/2018/07/25/lodash_reduce/) method when I was writing a little content on that library, but I find myself using lodash less and less these days. So I think it is called for now to write at least one [post on the array reduce method](https://dmitripavlutin.com/javascript-array-reduce/) in native core javaScript, and touch base on all kinds of little subjects that might come up as I work out a few basic examples and beyond.
