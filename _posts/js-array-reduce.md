This week I am expanding on javaScript arrays a little, and native JavaScript in general a bit, and have found that I have not yet wrote a post on the native Array reduce method. I have got around to writing a post on the lodash reduce method when I was writing a little content on that library, but I find myself using lodash less and less these days.
