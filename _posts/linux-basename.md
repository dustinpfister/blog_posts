When working out a bash script I might want to get just the base name of a path to a file or folder, one way to do so might be to use the [linux cut](/2020/11/19/linux-cut/) command, but there is also the [linux basename](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/basename-command-in-linux-with-examples/) command that can be used for this task.
