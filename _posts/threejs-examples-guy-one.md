I want to start thinking in terms of what the long term plan with [threejs](https://threejs.org/) might be for me if I am going to continue writing new posts on it. It would seem that I could write a lot more just when it comes to basic, and not so basic features of the library, and maybe with that alone there will always be something more to write about. However I think what I really need to start doing is making a [few examples](/2021/02/19/threejs-examples/) that are some kind of starting point for an actual project of some kind. With that said I think I will be writing about my first, basic guy, or person model using three.js that I made a while back, and then updated just a little for the sake of this post.

I actually have a number of crude modules that are really just a collection of mesh objects using the built in three.js geometries, rather than a professionally made model. I have nothing against making those kinds of modules, it is just that those kinds of modules can prove to be time consuming to make, and they do not always result in an over all better finished product in the end. Also I am taking into account what I want to really make with three.js and I am thinking more so in terms of animations in the fork of videos, rather than games. So all that matters in the end is if the final product looks the way I want it to when it comes to the final video and that is it. Crude modules might look crude, but if I am going for that kind of style to begin with, then they will work when it comes to that kind of style. What really matters most then is the over all finished product in terms of everything, not just the animation, and I am finding content on youtube that I would say are examples of doing this kind of angle right.

So when it comes to the kinds of over all scenes that I would like to make, I will want to have at least one, if not a few basic guy, or person type models. With that said this post is on one of my first modules for this sort of thing. This kind of module, and several other variations of it, has all ready appears in some of my other examples.
