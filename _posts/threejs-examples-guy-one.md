I want to start thinking in terms of what the long term plan with [threejs](https://threejs.org/) might be for me if I am going to continue writing new posts on it. It would seem that I could write a lot more just when it comes to basic, and not so basic features of the library, and maybe with that alone there will always be something more to write about. However I think what I really need to start doing is making a [few examples](/2021/02/19/threejs-examples/) that are some kind of starting point for an actual project of some kind. With that said I think I will be writing about my first, basic guy, or person model using three.js that I made a while back, and then updated just a little for the sake of this post.
