The [Linux cut](https://linuxize.com/post/linux-cut-command/) command is the standard tool for cutting a string into one or more sub strings. The first and for most way of using cut as I see it at least is by feild and delimiter, that is using a delimiter like a line break or a space as a way to split a string into feilds, and then using a feild index to get the sub string value that I want.

There are a few other options with The Linux cut command, but I will just be sticking to a few basic examples that actaully come into play when writing bash scripts.
