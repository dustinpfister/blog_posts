This [canvas example](/2020/03/23/canvas-example/) will be of a game spinner. In other words a virtual from of one of those things that you get in many board games that functions as an alternative to dice that has a spinner or arrow type thing attached to the center of a disk with a bunch of sections on it. So this canvas example will involve a module that can be used to create a state object for this sort of thing, and like aways a darw module that is used to draw the state of one of these to a canvas element.
