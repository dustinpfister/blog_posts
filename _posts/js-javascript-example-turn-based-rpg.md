This week the plain is to expand my collection of simple [JavaScript project examples](/2021/04/02/js-javascript-example/), this time a simple turned based rpg based on the source code of another [javaScript project example that has to do with grid unit movement](/2020/08/11/js-javascript-example-grid-game-unit-movement/). When it comes to the source code of the grid unit example I mad a whole lot of improvements to the source code of that example, and I thought that I should take the time to continue to expand on that source code but now as a whole other project folder.
