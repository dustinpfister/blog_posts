This week I think I would like to take a break from python to get back into writing a few new posts on vuejs. I have all ready wrote a number of posts on the basics of vuejs a while back, so now i think I should focus more on creating some actual simple projects with the framework. With that said I think it might be a good idea to make a few simple idle games with the framework, it just seems like something that might prove to be fun, and in the process I can also apply what I know so far when it comes to using vuejs as a client side framework.
