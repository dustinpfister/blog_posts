There are a lot of ideas that come to mind when it comes to making an [electronjs](https://www.electronjs.org/) project example, one of which would be to make a [file manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_manager). This is one of many project ideas where getting the core set of features working might not take to long, but in the long run can turn into a major project that can take months, or even years to refine if doing so is justified. The starting point I had in mind was to just have a way to navigate around a file system, and be able to start a terminal window at the current working folder. Just that alone is simple enough for sure, but then there is working on the additional basic features that one would expect of any file manager, and how to go about doing just that. There is working out javaScript solutions for everything, but then there is also the idea of using the child process module to make use of binaries that there are to work with in the underlaying OS and being done with it.
