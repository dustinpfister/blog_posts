I have come to like the [Rasbian Linux OS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspbian), and my [raspberry pi 3B+](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi). When it comes to looking for a new computer less is more for me these days as I have found that everything that I really want and need to do with a computer does not require a whole lot of overhead. In addition I would like to start writing at least a little more content on Linux, so todays post will be on getting started with Raspbian Linux lite.
