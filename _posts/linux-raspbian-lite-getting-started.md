I have come to like the [Rasbian Linux OS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspbian), and my [raspberry pi 3B+](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi). When it comes to looking for a new computer less is more for me these days as I have found that everything that I really want and need to do with a computer does not require a whole lot of overhead. In addition I would like to start writing at least a little more content on Linux, so todays post will be on getting started with Raspbian Linux lite.

## 1 - Download an up to date Raspbian Linux lite image

First off download an up to date image of the [Raspbian OS from the raspberrypi.org website](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/). There should be some other options there that have more features pre installed, but I like to start with the lite package as I do not use a lot of the software that the full desktop ones use. It is also possible to upgrade to one of them at a later point if you change your mind anyway.
