## 1 - Canvas games basics

So in order to get started with canvas it would be a good idea to learn a thing or two about javaScript to begin with if you have not done so before hand. I will not be covering the basics of javaScript development here, there will be some simple copy and past examples, but you need to know the basics of how to get them working.
