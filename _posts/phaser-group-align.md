If you have a collection of sprites in a [phaser ce](https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser-ce/index.html) project and you want to align them into a grid, it is not to hard to just do it by working out a method. However why bother with that when there is a method that is part of the group class itself? There is of course group.align that can be used to do this, and it does it fairly well with some nice features that can be used to tweak things a bit. Never the less in this post I will be writing about some examples that have to do with aligning sprites, and other display objects in a group in phaser ce.
