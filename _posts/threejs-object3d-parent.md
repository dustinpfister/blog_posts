I have been taking a second long look at everything there is to work with in the object3d class in threejs, and it turns out that there is still a great deal more to the class that I still feel as though I need to get solid with. One such property of the object3d class is the parent property of an object3d instance which is something that can come in handy now and then just like that of the children property. That is where the children property might be a collection of other objects that are descendant of an object, the parent property is well the parent of the current object.
