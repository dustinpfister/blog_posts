Over the last few days I was working on yet another one of my [javaScript examples](/2021/04/02/js-javascript-example/) this time it is yet another Digital Art Projects based off of [revision 5 of my first Object Pool Reduction digital art example](/2021/12/31/js-javascript-example-digital-art-reduce-pool/) that I started late last year.

<!-- more -->

## 1 - The utilities library

The [utilities library](/2021/08/06/js-javascript-example-utils/) for this example contains a number of methods that I will be using throughout the other files in this over all project. So then many of these methods are usual suspect type methods that I end up using in just about any other javaScript example of mine, but I sill keep the example more or less custom cut for the specific project.

```js
```

## 2 - The star module

The star module that I am suing for this example is based off of what I worked out for my older [canvas example project and drawing stars](/2020/02/12/canvas-example-star/).

```js
```

## 3 - The object pool module

The object pool module was copied over from the other digital art example that I started this out from. It started out with what what I put together with in my [canvas example on object pools](/2020/07/20/canvas-example-object-pool/). Sense then I keep making little changes to it here and there as needed, and over time I slowly but surly have a more solid module for this sort of thing.

```js
```

## 4 - The game module

```js
```

## 5 - The draw module

```js
```

## 6 - The main javaScript file

```js
```


## 7 - Conclusion
