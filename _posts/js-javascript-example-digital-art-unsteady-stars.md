Over the last few days I was working on yet another one of my [javaScript examples](/2021/04/02/js-javascript-example/) this time it is yet another Digital Art Projects based off of [revision 5 of my first Object Pool Reduction digital art example](/2021/12/31/js-javascript-example-digital-art-reduce-pool/) that I started late last year.

<!-- more -->

## 1 - The utilities library

The [utilities library](/2021/08/06/js-javascript-example-utils/) for this example contains a number of methods that I will be using throughout the other files in this over all project. So then many of these methods are usual suspect type methods that I end up using in just about any other javaScript example of mine, but I sill keep the example more or less custom cut for the specific project.

```js
```

## 2 - The star module

```js
```

## 3 - The object pool module

```js
```

## 4 - The game module

```js
```

## 5 - The draw module

```js
```

## 6 - The main javaScript file

```js
```


## 7 - Conclusion
