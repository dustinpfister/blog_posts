WHen working on various [javaScript examples](/2021/04/02/js-javascript-example/) I often run into problems that have to do with angles. I often find or make solutions for these problems, but they ended up littered all over various collections of examples, and I can not always remember where a certain method that solves a given problem with angles can be found. So I thought it would be a good idea to start a javaScript example that is a stand alone module that can be used to work with angles, and various problems that have to do with angles.
