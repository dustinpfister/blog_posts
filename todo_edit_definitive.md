# todo list for editing blog_posts to make them definitive

This is a todo list that I have started to help track progress with a few select posts where the aim is to make them definitive. The term definitive can prove to very much be a subjective term, but maybe not so much when I define some kind of strict definition of what that means, for me at least anyway.

## What "definitive" means in terms of word count

Of course this will really change from one post to another when it comes to the subject matter. With certain things there really is only so much to write about actually. However when it comes to setting some kind of standard for this thing I have to have a figure so then here it is:

* 3,000+ words (min)
* as much as 10,000 (max)

## what "definitive" means beyond just word count

Of course there are some more things that come to mind other than just simply writing a lot about something, that alone can prove to be cheep if it is just a whole lot of padding. What that said there are a lot more things that should be done to help make these posts not just really long, but also of substance of course. So lets keep some things in mind while doing this such as:

### - Proof read, quality

* Proof Read for simple spelling, and language mistakes.
* Proof Read for the sake of sensing if content is maybe to dry, and find ways of making it more fun
* Branch off into related topics if needed

### - Source code examples

* Create simple use case examples that might even be full applications actually if needed.
* have source source examples in a Github repository and link to that repository in the post
* have a README file in the repository and link to the post from there
* posts should have a basics section, then one or more advanced sections, followed by one or more examples sections

### - justification of why I should go all out with a post

It will take a great investment of time to create a post that will be at least some three thousand words or more. There is not just the amount of time it will take to write the content, but also preforming research, as well as writing and hacking over source code examples. So then for each item in this todo list I should list at least one or more of the following as a way to outline what the justification is for putting in the time to write and edit posts to this extreme.

#### - Intrinsic Value

There is the [intrinsic value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrinsic_value_%28ethics%29) in terms of ethics rather than finances. what this means that there is, at the very least, a degree of justification to invest time in writing and preforming research to create a long from content piece just for the sake of doing so. Even if the post ends up being a total flop in terms of traffic and money if something is gained in terms of learning something of value then it is not a total loss.

#### - Search Console 

If the post is all ready preforming well in terms or organic search results then that is a good justification for improving the quality of the content to the Nth degree.

#### - Google Trends

If the post is new, or an older post that is not preforming so well, however there is one or more keywords that I have found in Google Trends that is of great interest, then that can count as justification. When making note of this as justification I should take note of what keywords that are of interest with the list item. A good rule of thumb is to compare the keyword of interest to the best preforming keyword in search console.
