# todo list for editing blog_posts to make them definitive

This is a todo list that I have started to help track progress with a few select posts where the aim is to make them definitive. The term definitive can prove to very much be a subjective term, but maybe not so much when I define some kind of strict definition of what that means, for me at least anyway.

## What "definitive" means in terms of word count

Of course this will really change from one post to another when it comes to the subject matter. With certain things there really is only so much to write about actually. However when it comes to setting some kind of standard for this thing I have to have a figure so then here it is:

* 3,000+ words



<!--###### ########## ########## #######-->
## js ( /yyyy/mm/dd/js-* )
<!--###### ########## ########## #######-->

## js-promise-resolve-reject
* get post to the min 3000+ words
