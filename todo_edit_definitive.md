# todo list for editing blog_posts to make them definitive

This is a todo list that I have started to help track progress with a few select posts where the aim is to make them definitive. The term definitive can prove to very much be a subjective term, but maybe not so much when I define some kind of strict definition of what that means, for me at least anyway.

## What "definitive" means in terms of word count

Of course this will really change from one post to another when it comes to the subject matter. With certain things there really is only so much to write about actually. However when it comes to setting some kind of standard for this thing I have to have a figure so then here it is:

* 3,000+ words (min)
* as much as 10,000 (max)

## what "definitive" means beyond just word count

Of course there are some more things that come to mind other than just simply writing a lot about something, that alone can prove to be cheep if it is just a whole lot of padding. What that said there are a lot more things that should be done to help make these posts not just really long, but also of substance of course. So lets keep some things in mind while doing this such as:

### - Proof read, quality

* Proof Read for simple spelling, and language mistakes.
* Proof Read for the sake of sensing if content is maybe to dry, and find ways of making it more fun
* Branch off into related topics if needed

### - Source code examples

* Create simple use case examples that might even be full applications actually if needed.
* have source source examples in a Github repository and link to that repository in the post
* have a README file in the repository and link to the post from there
* posts should have a basics section, then one or more advanced sections, followed by one or more examples sections

### - justification of why I should go all out with a post

It will take a great investment of time to create a post that will be at least some three thousand words or more. There is not just the amount of time it will take to write the content, but also preforming research, as well as writing and hacking over source code examples. So then for each item in this todo list I should list at least one or more of the following as a way to outline what the justification is for putting in the time to write and edit posts to this extreme.

#### - Intrinsic Value

There is the [intrinsic value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrinsic_value_%28ethics%29) in terms of ethics rather than finances. what this means that there is, at the very least, a degree of justification to invest time in writing and preforming research to create a long from content piece just for the sake of doing so. Even if the post ends up being a total flop in terms of traffic and money if something is gained in terms of learning something of value then it is not a total loss.

#### - Search Console 

If the post is all ready preforming well in terms or organic search results then that is a good justification for improving the quality of the content to the Nth degree.

#### - Google Trends

If the post is new, or an older post that is not preforming so well, however there is one or more keywords that I have found in Google Trends that is of great interest, then that can count as justification. When making note of this as justification I should take note of what keywords that are of interest with the list item. A good rule of thumb is to compare the keyword of interest to the best preforming keyword in search console.

<!--###### ########## ########## #######-->
## js ( /yyyy/mm/dd/linux-* )
<!--###### ########## ########## #######-->

## linux-bash-script-parameters-named ( looking good in search console)
    justification: 
      Intrinsic Value: This is a good topic and not just with bash, there is also other languages
      Search Console: doing okay in a relative way as of 11/5/2021
      Google Trends: "bash arguments", "bash parameters", "bash named arguments"
          Doing well in search console with "bash named arguments" keyword, and it would seem there 
          there are many other keywords that show there is a great deal of search interest for this topic.
          When it comes to the intrinsic value of just wring more about this there is also touching base on the
          Topic of option parsing in general, nit just with bash.
* get post to 3000+ words

## js-innerHTML ( Search Console Best Performance for js cat - clicks - 10/25/21 )

    justification:
      Intrinsic Value: Not much for me at least, this is a trivial topic
      Search Console: Best preforming post for js cat, "innerhtml alternative" keyword looking good
      Google Trends: "innerhtml", "inner html","js innerhtml"

        This is a very dull subject for me, however it is the best preforming post in the js category as of 11/09/2021 so
        I will need to expand and improve it for that reason. The post is pulling in some clicks from a few keywords
        all ready, and it would seem that the "innerhtml" keyword would be the white whale keyword for this topic when it comes
        to doing keyword research on this topic at Google trends. So then there is all ready proof that this is a subject that 
        is in demand, and also I can see lots of room for growth. 

        As for the Intrinsic value problem though the best angle might be to expand a lot more with the topic of what the best preforming keyword is thus far witch is "innerhtml alternative". For example there is not just thinking in terms 
        of DOM element when it comes to displaying data, or results in a web page. So maybe I can get away with writing about 
        things beyond just that of the document.createElement method such as canvas elements and SVG. After all the whole 
        reason of using inner html is often for the sake of generating something to display some info or data, and that can 
        be done with things other than just with DOM Elements in client side javaScript.

* get to 4000+ words

## js-javascript-mouse ( interesting topic, at 2000+ words all ready, good keywords ie: javaScript mouse )
    justification:
      Intrinsic Value: There are a lot of interesting little details to be aware of.
      Search Console: None
      Google Trends: "javascript mouse", "js mouse"
        There is a whole lot to write about and not just when it comes to the mouse, but pointer objects in general.
        This is also a topic where there seems to be a whole lot of search interest, however it is not a situation in
        Which I am trying to make a good situation even better, search console performance is very poor as of this
        writing ( 11/09/2021 )

* (done 10/21/2021) get post to the min 3000+ words
* (done 10/24/2021) get post to 4000+ words
* (done 11/02/2021) get post to 4500+ words
* get post to 5000+ words

## js-event-object ( at 2,600+ all ready, good topic )
    justification: 
      Intrinsic Value: Good Topic, ties into a whole lot of other things
      Search Console: None
      Google Trends: "js event", "js e", "javascript event object", "js event object"
          Very significant search interest for this one, and there is a whole lot of ground to cover.
list:
* (done 11/04/2021) get post to 3000+ words min for this kind of post
* (done 11/08/2021) get post to 4000+ words min for this kind of post
* get post to 4500+ words min for this kind of post


## js-operator-precedence ( interesting topic )
    justification: 
      Intrinsic Value: Good topic, lots of interesting expressions can be used as examples.
      Search Console: Seeing a lot of impressions for  "javascript order of operations"
      Google Trends: "javascript order of operations"
         All ready showing up for on eof the best keywords that I have found thus far. The post still needs a lot of 
         work though when it comes to examples for each operator. No problem when it comes to intrinsic value with this
         one two because it is closely tied with writing expressions in javaScript. So there is a whole world of examples
         that can be used when it comes to writing about order of operations.
* get post to 3000+ words

## js-regex ( A whole lot to write about )
    justification: 
      Intrinsic Value: There is a lot to write about, I have more to learn with new features
      Search Console: No keywords as of 11/10/2021
      Google Trends: "regex", "regular expressions", "javascript regex", "js regex"
         There is a whole lot more to write about so getting this post to a super high word count would not be hard in terms of finding relevant things to write about, not problem there at all. In Search console it is not doing so well, but the problem is not at all because there is a lack of search interest for this. This post is a good fit when it comes to the idea of working on something where there is a whole lot of room for growth, and I will not have to worry about getting board, but the one draw back is that it is not a situation in which I am trying to improve something that is all ready a good thing.
* get the post to 3000+ words

## js-svg ( A whole lot to write about )
    justification:
      Intrinsic Value: There is a lot to write about, and a lot more to learn and research
      Search Console: None, doing very poorly thus far
      Google Trends: "javascript svg", "js svg", "svg viewbox"
* get the post to 3000+ words
