# todo list for editing blog_posts to make them definitive

This is a todo list that I have started to help track progress with a few select posts where the aim is to make them definitive. The term definitive can prove to very much be a subjective term, but maybe not so much when I define some kind of strict definition of what that means, for me at least anyway.

## What "definitive" means in terms of word count

Of course this will really change from one post to another when it comes to the subject matter. With certain things there really is only so much to write about actually. However when it comes to setting some kind of standard for this thing I have to have a figure so then here it is:

* 3,000+ words (min)
* as much as 10,000 (max)

## what "definitive" means beyond just word count

Of course there are some more things that come to mind other than just simply writing a lot about something, that alone can prove to be cheep if it is just a whole lot of padding. What that said there are a lot more things that should be done to help make these posts not just really long, but also of substance of course. So lets keep some things in mind while doing this such as:

### - Proof read, quality

* Proof Read for simple spelling, and language mistakes.
* Proof Read for the sake of sensing if content is maybe to dry, and find ways of making it more fun
* Branch off into related topics if needed

### - Source code examples

* Create simple use case examples that might even be full applications actually if needed.
* have source source examples in a Github repository and link to that repository in the post
* have a README file in the repository and link to the post from there
* posts should have a basics section, then one or more advanced sections, followed by one or more examples sections

### - Selecting posts to go all out with

* Select posts that are all ready preforming okay
* Select posts that have the potential to preform well by doing some quick trend research
* Select posts just because they are a interesting topic
