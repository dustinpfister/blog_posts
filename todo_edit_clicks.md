# todo list for editing blog_posts based on clicks

This is a todo list where editing is prioritized based just purely on how much traffic the post is getting based on what I am seeing in goggle search console. The general idea with this list is that the more traffic a post gets, the more effort I should put into that post to make sure the text, code, and over all quality of the post is decent.

## Some things to keep in mind with this

* keep this list just at a top 10 over all for the site as a whole for now
* per category type decisions things should not be dictated by this list
* the format for each listing header should be ( done MM/DD/YYYY ) - POST_FILE_NAME ( #RANK - CLICKS - DATE_LIST )
* CLICKS should be the number of clicks that the post got over 3 Months sense DATE_LIST in google search console

### ( ) - lodash_sum ( #1 - 1,736 clicks - 10/02/2021 )
* (done) edit post to 1,000+ words
* (done) edit post to 1,800+ words
* (done) have 5+ internal links for the post
