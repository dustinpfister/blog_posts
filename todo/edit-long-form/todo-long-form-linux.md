## linux-bash-script-parameters-named ( looking good in search console)
    justification: 
      Intrinsic Value: This is a good topic and not just with bash, there is also other languages
      Search Console: doing okay in a relative way as of 11/5/2021
      Google Trends: "bash arguments", "bash parameters", "bash named arguments"
          Doing well in search console with "bash named arguments" keyword, and it would seem there 
          there are many other keywords that show there is a great deal of search interest for this topic.
          When it comes to the intrinsic value of just wring more about this there is also touching base on the
          Topic of option parsing in general, nit just with bash.
