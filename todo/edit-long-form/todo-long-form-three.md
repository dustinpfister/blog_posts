        As of 11/13/2021 this is my best preforming post on threejs, I am all ready doing well with certain keywords, and I am sure there is room for more growth on this one. It should also go without saying that this topic is anything but boring, so I should have no trouble at all expanding this post into a long from content piece.

         The thing about this one is that it is on a topic that only applies to older versions of threejs now. However the post is still getting a lot of traffic, so there is shifting the focus on how to do what this was once all about in newer versions of threejs. Also there is still keeping the older content up, just pushing it down to the bottom of the post and making it clear that the older source code examples only apply to older versions of threejs.
