## js-javascript-foreach ( All is Good with this one! Must go the distance )
      Intrinsic Value: There are a lot of interesting little details, branches off into all kinds of interesting topics.
      Search Console: Doing well in a relative way for the js category "javascript foreach sum value", "javascript foreach"
      Google Trends: "javascript foreach", "array foreach", "js foreach"
        All is well with this post when it comes to having an interesting topic, showing potential in search console, and having some eyebrow raising keywords to target in Google trends. The post is all ready a lengthly content piece, so much of the work from this post forward will have to do with editing what I have together all ready. This is not to say that there is not still a whole lot of room for expansion also. This should maybe be the first post that I take to the front of the whole pack that I have written thus far when it comes to taking something into the range of five thousand plus words. As if this writing I have only one other post that long which is my main canvas-example post.

## js-javascript-example-grid-game-unit-movement
      Intrinsic Value: This is a good topic that relates to work on my actual game framework project
      Search Console: best preforming "js-javascript-example-\*" post as of 12/2/21
      Google Trends: "javascript grid"
        This is a great topic that has to do with work I would like to do on my framework project called Clucker. On top of that this post is the best preforming post in my javaScript example series of posts as of this writing so it makes sense to work on it more for that reason also. On top of that I lack javaScript example series posts that are in the 3,000+ word count range, and I would like for this whole collection to preform better.

## js-innerHTML ( Search Console Best Performance for js cat - clicks - 10/25/21 )

    justification:
      Intrinsic Value: Not much for me at least, this is a trivial topic
      Search Console: Best preforming post for js cat, "innerhtml alternative" keyword looking good
      Google Trends: "innerhtml", "inner html","js innerhtml"
        This is a very dull subject for me, however it is the best preforming post in the js category as of 11/09/2021 so I will need to expand and improve it for that reason. The post is pulling in some clicks from a few keywords all ready, and it would seem that the "innerhtml" keyword would be the white whale keyword for this topic when it comes to doing keyword research on this topic at Google trends. So then there is all ready proof that this is a subject that is in demand, and also I can see lots of room for growth. 

        As for the Intrinsic value problem though the best angle might be to expand a lot more with the topic of what the best preforming keyword is thus far witch is "innerhtml alternative". For example there is not just thinking in terms of DOM element when it comes to displaying data, or results in a web page. So maybe I can get away with writing about things beyond just that of the document.createElement method such as canvas elements and SVG. After all the whole reason of using inner html is often for the sake of generating something to display some info or data, and that can be done with things other than just with DOM Elements in client side javaScript.

## js-javascript-mouse ( interesting topic, at 2000+ words all ready, good keywords ie: javaScript mouse )
    justification:
      Intrinsic Value: There are a lot of interesting little details to be aware of.
      Search Console: None
      Google Trends: "javascript mouse", "js mouse"
        There is a whole lot to write about and not just when it comes to the mouse, but pointer objects in general.
        This is also a topic where there seems to be a whole lot of search interest, however it is not a situation in
        Which I am trying to make a good situation even better, search console performance is very poor as of this

## js-event-object ( at 2,600+ all ready, good topic )
    justification: 
      Intrinsic Value: Good Topic, ties into a whole lot of other things
      Search Console: None
      Google Trends: "js event", "js e", "javascript event object", "js event object"
          Very significant search interest for this one, and there is a whole lot of ground to cover.

## js-operator-precedence ( interesting topic )
    justification: 
      Intrinsic Value: Good topic, lots of interesting expressions can be used as examples.
      Search Console: Seeing a lot of impressions for  "javascript order of operations"
      Google Trends: "javascript order of operations"
         All ready showing up for on eof the best keywords that I have found thus far. The post still needs a lot of 
         work though when it comes to examples for each operator. No problem when it comes to intrinsic value with this
         one two because it is closely tied with writing expressions in javaScript. So there is a whole world of examples
         that can be used when it comes to writing about order of operations.

## js-regex ( A whole lot to write about )
    justification: 
      Intrinsic Value: There is a lot to write about, I have more to learn with new features
      Search Console: No keywords as of 11/10/2021
      Google Trends: "regex", "regular expressions", "javascript regex", "js regex"
         There is a whole lot more to write about so getting this post to a super high word count would not be hard in terms of finding relevant things to write about, not problem there at all. In Search console it is not doing so well, but the problem is not at all because there is a lack of search interest for this. This post is a good fit when it comes to the idea of working on something where there is a whole lot of room for growth, and I will not have to worry about getting board, but the one draw back is that it is not a situation in which I am trying to improve something that is all ready a good thing.

## js-array-reduce ( Fun canvas example planed )
    justification:
      Intrinsic Value: I would like to make a fun canvas example for it
      Search Console: "javascript array reduce"
      Google Trends: "array reduce", "js array reduce"
        I edited this post on 11/25/2021 and went off the deep end with it a little as such the post is all ready close to 3000 words to begin with. The array reduce method is also an interesting topic so there is a lot more to write about with it when it comes to use case examples. With that said I thunk it will be fun to make a canvas examples involving just some simple objects moving around and using the array reduce method to reduce as well as increase an array that is a section of objects in an object pool.

## js-array-fill( Cool library idea I would like to create and write about )
    justification:
      Intrinsic Value: I have a nice library idea for this post I would like to complete
      Search Console: "javascript array fill" showing up once in a while
      Google Trends: "array fill", "js fill", "js array fill"
         The post on the array fill command as well as creating a filled array in general is all ready pretty long to begin with. On top of that there is a great deal more I would like to write on this subject when it comes to what I have together thus far. As of 11/26/2021 the post is showing up for "javascript array fill" in search console, but with a very poor ranking. However this keyword is fairly valuable when compared to my best preforming keyword at this time when looking into things at Google trends. It would seem that the "array fill" keyword is showing a very high volume in Google trends, and I am sure there are many others. So there is a great deal of demand for a content piece such as this, I just need to make it the kind of post that is worthy of the rank for starters.

## js-array ( A whole lot more to do with this one )
    justification:
      Intrinsic Value: For my own sake it is good to have a long central post on arrays
      Search Console: none
      Google Trends: "javaScript array", "js array"
         This post is all ready very long, and I have a lot planed out to make it even longer. It would be nice for the sake of my own notes to have a nice long central post on arrays in javaScript, this post is that all ready, and it makes sense to make it even longer. The post is preforming very poorly in search console, but it was in poor shape actually although fairly long. I fixed it up a whole lot as of 11/28/2021, but there is a great deal more room for improvement with this post. It would be easy to make this one of more first posts that is over 10k words it i take it that far, and then have a wait and see when it comes to finding out if going that nuts helps or not. There is a crazy amount of search interest in this topic looking at just two major keywords with it, so it is not like there is not a demand for this kind of post.

## js-javascript-svg ( A whole lot to write about )
    justification:
      Intrinsic Value: There is a lot to write about, and a lot more to learn and research
      Search Console: None, doing very poorly thus far
      Google Trends: "javascript svg", "js svg", "svg viewbox"
          This is very much an interesting topic, and a nice break from the usual content that I like to write on canvas so it might help when it comes to getting burnt out on that topic. The post can be expanding on a whole lot, so it would be easy to come up with over three thousand words of substance on this which is also great. Thus far the post is preforming very poorly in search console, but that is not at all because of lack of search interest on SVG. Improving the quality of the post might help then so this is a good post to have on this list
