## js-javascript-foreach ( All is Good with this one! Must go the distance )
      Intrinsic Value: There are a lot of interesting little details, branches off into all kinds of interesting topics.
      Search Console: Doing well in a relative way for the js category "javascript foreach sum value", "javascript foreach"
      Google Trends: "javascript foreach", "array foreach", "js foreach"
        All is well with this post when it comes to having an interesting topic, showing potential in search console, and having some eyebrow raising keywords to target in Google trends. The post is all ready a lengthly content piece, so much of the work from this post forward will have to do with editing what I have together all ready. This is not to say that there is not still a whole lot of room for expansion also. This should maybe be the first post that I take to the front of the whole pack that I have written thus far when it comes to taking something into the range of five thousand plus words. As if this writing I have only one other post that long which is my main canvas-example post.

## js-innerHTML ( Search Console Best Performance for js cat - clicks - 10/25/21 )

    justification:
      Intrinsic Value: Not much for me at least, this is a trivial topic
      Search Console: Best preforming post for js cat, "innerhtml alternative" keyword looking good
      Google Trends: "innerhtml", "inner html","js innerhtml"

        This is a very dull subject for me, however it is the best preforming post in the js category as of 11/09/2021 so
        I will need to expand and improve it for that reason. The post is pulling in some clicks from a few keywords
        all ready, and it would seem that the "innerhtml" keyword would be the white whale keyword for this topic when it comes
        to doing keyword research on this topic at Google trends. So then there is all ready proof that this is a subject that 
        is in demand, and also I can see lots of room for growth. 

        As for the Intrinsic value problem though the best angle might be to expand a lot more with the topic of what the best preforming keyword is thus far witch is "innerhtml alternative". For example there is not just thinking in terms 
        of DOM element when it comes to displaying data, or results in a web page. So maybe I can get away with writing about 
        things beyond just that of the document.createElement method such as canvas elements and SVG. After all the whole 
        reason of using inner html is often for the sake of generating something to display some info or data, and that can 
        be done with things other than just with DOM Elements in client side javaScript.

## js-javascript-mouse ( interesting topic, at 2000+ words all ready, good keywords ie: javaScript mouse )
    justification:
      Intrinsic Value: There are a lot of interesting little details to be aware of.
      Search Console: None
      Google Trends: "javascript mouse", "js mouse"
        There is a whole lot to write about and not just when it comes to the mouse, but pointer objects in general.
        This is also a topic where there seems to be a whole lot of search interest, however it is not a situation in
        Which I am trying to make a good situation even better, search console performance is very poor as of this
        writing ( 11/09/2021 )

## js-event-object ( at 2,600+ all ready, good topic )
    justification: 
      Intrinsic Value: Good Topic, ties into a whole lot of other things
      Search Console: None
      Google Trends: "js event", "js e", "javascript event object", "js event object"
          Very significant search interest for this one, and there is a whole lot of ground to cover.
list:
* (done 11/04/2021) get post to 3000+ words min for this kind of post
* (done 11/08/2021) get post to 4000+ words min for this kind of post
* get post to 4500+ words min for this kind of post


## js-operator-precedence ( interesting topic )
    justification: 
      Intrinsic Value: Good topic, lots of interesting expressions can be used as examples.
      Search Console: Seeing a lot of impressions for  "javascript order of operations"
      Google Trends: "javascript order of operations"
         All ready showing up for on eof the best keywords that I have found thus far. The post still needs a lot of 
         work though when it comes to examples for each operator. No problem when it comes to intrinsic value with this
         one two because it is closely tied with writing expressions in javaScript. So there is a whole world of examples
         that can be used when it comes to writing about order of operations.

## js-regex ( A whole lot to write about )
    justification: 
      Intrinsic Value: There is a lot to write about, I have more to learn with new features
      Search Console: No keywords as of 11/10/2021
      Google Trends: "regex", "regular expressions", "javascript regex", "js regex"
         There is a whole lot more to write about so getting this post to a super high word count would not be hard in terms of finding relevant things to write about, not problem there at all. In Search console it is not doing so well, but the problem is not at all because there is a lack of search interest for this. This post is a good fit when it comes to the idea of working on something where there is a whole lot of room for growth, and I will not have to worry about getting board, but the one draw back is that it is not a situation in which I am trying to improve something that is all ready a good thing.

## js-svg ( A whole lot to write about )
    justification:
      Intrinsic Value: There is a lot to write about, and a lot more to learn and research
      Search Console: None, doing very poorly thus far
      Google Trends: "javascript svg", "js svg", "svg viewbox"
          This is very much an interesting topic, and a nice break from the usual content that I like to write on canvas so it might help when it comes to getting burnt out on that topic. The post can be expanding on a whole lot, so it would be easy to come up with over three thousand words of substance on this which is also great. Thus far the post is preforming very poorly in search console, but that is not at all because of lack of search interest on SVG. Improving the quality of the post might help then so this is a good post to have on this list

## js-array-reduce ( Fun canvas example planed )
    justification:
      Intrinsic Value: I would like to make a fun canvas example for it
      Search Console: 
      Google Trends:
        I edited this post on 11/25/2021 and went off the deep end with it a little as such the post is all ready close to 3000 words to begin with. The array reduce method is also an interesting topic so there is a lot more to write about with it when it comes to use case examples. With that said I thunk it will be fun to make a canvas examples involving just some simple objects moving around and using the array reduce method to reduce as well as increase an array that is a section of objects in an object pool.
