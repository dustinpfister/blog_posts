## lodash ( just want to improve quality more )
    justification: 
      Intrinsic Value: I am linking to this a lot from other posts, so I want it in better shape
      Search Console: none
      Google Trends: "lodash"
         The main reason why I want to make this post long form is just for the intrinsic value of improving the quality of th post which as of this writing is still not that great. Another factor of concern with this is that I am linking to this post from a whole lot of other posts on lodash, and as such each time someone clicks threw to this post I want them to be presented with something of real value.
