# todo list for April 2022

VIDEOGROUND, THREEJS, ELECTRONJS, LINUX, MVP-LITTLE-CITY

For this month I want to make the main focus on my new VideoGround project, and thus also various other topics that relate to VideoGround such as threejs. Over the long term I thing that I will want to keep the focus with threejs, and also Linux as one other topic.

I finished up with the process of quick edits last week, now I can start focusing more so I just one or two posts each day and put a little more effort into what I change and add for each post that I revise. For this week I am thinking that I should stick with about two posts per day, and the process should involve a full proof read, link to test threejs, and even an optional demo video. 

This might prove to be a bit to much, but maybe only for the long run at least. If I do say in my lane with this category in time two a day will become one a day, and even eventually one a week.

This week I would like to focus on getting the bulk of the quick edits of my whole catalog of threejs content done. I might not get this finished this week, but I would still like to get this out of the way so I can then shift gears and go in the direction of starting a process of editing that has more to do with quality rather than quantity of editing.

Outside of the editing of threejs content there is also writing new threejs posts this week, and also working on more videos for posts as well as getting at least a little done on the beta world project when it comes to videos.
