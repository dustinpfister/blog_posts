## () - SUN 09/25/2022 to  FRI 09/30/2022

This week I will like to get a current list of best preforming posts for threejs, say a top ten or so, and start focusing just on those posts in terms of editing text, creating more examples, and also additional videos. I might have a single exception or two this week but for the most part that is what I would like to start doing.

So then
    * Focus on top ten posts in threejs
    * new post for Friday

This is the current list as of 09/26/2022
```
POST                                                        CLICKS  IMPRESSIONS
/2022/04/04/threejs-object3d-position/                      285     4,887
/2021/06/07/threejs-buffer-geometry-attributes-position/    176     2,649
/2018/04/17/threejs-canvas-texture/                         149     1,693
/2021/05/13/threejs-object3d-lookat/                        145     2,705
/2021/06/03/threejs-object3d-traverse/                      133     1,600
/2021/06/09/threejs-buffer-geometry-attributes-uv/          128     922
/2018/05/16/threejs-grouping-mesh-objects/                  110     2,269
/2021/04/21/threejs-materials-transparent/                  104     3,815
/2018/04/16/threejs-fog/                                    104     1,389
/2021/05/11/threejs-object3d-scale/                         100     2,781
```

So this week I think I will start with threejs-object3d-position as a subject to keep working on a little each day. I will also want to make a video2 for this as well that I will not want to rush. I should also start to edit some of these other posts while I am at it, bit I am thinking that it would be a good idea to focus on one of 10 each week.
