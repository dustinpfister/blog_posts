# todo list for August 2022

VIDEOGROUND,  VIDEOGROUND-BLOG-POSTS, THREEJS, VIDEOGROUND-BETAWORLD

Late last month I started working on improving video ground which I have been using regularly to make videos that I then post on youtube. This is something that I think I should continue with into the start of August at least, and with it more content of course when it comes to blog post videos at least. 

For the last few months I have been focusing mainly just on threejs when it comes to editing older content as well as writing new content, and thus far there are not plains on changing that.
