# todo list for May 2022

THREEJS, VIDEOGROUND, ELECTRONJS, JS, VUEJS, LINUX

This month I think the plan should be to stay in my lane with threejs for at least one more Month. Durring this time I should also work on my videoground project as that is clsly related to doing so. With that said there is also the potential to write about other things to which videground is based on.
