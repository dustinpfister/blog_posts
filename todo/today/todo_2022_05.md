# todo list for May 2022

THREEJS, VIDEOGROUND, ELECTRONJS, JS, VUEJS, LINUX

This month I think the plan should be to stay in my lane with threejs for at least one more Month. During this time I should also work on my videoground project as that is closely related to doing so. With that said there is also the potential to write about other things to which videoground is based on, but For now I am thinking I should get as much out of the way with my blog post videos.

This week I am thinking that I should try out just making only one blog post video per day, and as such focus a little more on what my other collection of videos 'beta world' is going to be about. Also when it comes to editing old threejs posts I can now think in terms of just one post per day, and giving just that one post a greater deal of attraction. New posts this week should be on the THREE.Box3 class which is one thing that I have not got around to write a post on yet, and at least one more additional threejs examples post.

This week the main focus was on getting a lot more of the quick place holder type videos for my blog posts, aiming for at least two a day but as many as four or more if possible.
