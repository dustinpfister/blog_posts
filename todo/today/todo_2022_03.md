# todo list for Mar 2022

In march I am thinking about expanding my Linux content as I am thinking that might be a good move.

## new posts
* new content on Linux as that seems to be doing well, and I would like to expand on that regardless
* new js cat posts on typical javaScript prototype project as needed

## editing 
* light editing of js posts, mainly long form posts only
* continue with lodash, but also just light touch up type edits, no long form posts for now with lodash

So then a single day might look something like this
```
* new post on election
* todo-long-from-js one item
* todo-edit-lodash one item
* work on linux proto folder project on a command, or linux feature
```
