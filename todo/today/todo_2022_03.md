# todo list for March 2022

LINUX, ELECTRON.JS, THREEJS, MVP-LITTLE-CITY

So it looks like my content on Linux is growing, as such I should take a moment to expand on that just for that reason alone of course. However it is a topic that I think I can really get behind also at a personal level regardless of how well the content is preforming. 

Linux goes far beyond just being an operating system kernel, for example there are the legal reasons why Linux is great. For example there is the whole Linux is free as in free beer angle when it comes to not having to pay for licensing, but also the Linux is free as in free speech angle. Anyone can just pull down the source code, make improvements, and republish as long as that code is released under the terms of a similar license to that of the GPL.

Outside of Linux I am going to want to continue expanding on my new collection of content on electron.js as well, until I have a solid collection of posts on that topic. This can include working on electron application examples such as my text editor prototype, as well as videoground, and maybe one game example based on my MVP-LITTLE-CITY project that I have been working on sense January.
