# todo list for HULY 2023

videoground, THREEJS, Linux

I would like to expand more with the use of video ground to make videos. This means making more improvements to the program itself, and also starting new collections of content. With that said I will also want to keep up with threejs demos, posts, and so forth. The only other topic that I would slo like to expand on more for now is just Linux content as the only minor diversion from this.
