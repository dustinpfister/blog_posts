# todo list for HULY 2023

'tri12 project', videoground, THREEJS, Linux

I would like to expand more with the use of video ground to make videos. This means making more improvements to the program itself, and also starting new collections of content. With that said I will also want to keep up with threejs demos, posts, and so forth as always. However I would like to start a 'tri12' project that will be a collection of modules composed of no more that 12 triangles. These can be used in my video ground projects when it comes to blog post videos, but I think the best way forward with this would be to start a whole other collection of video content. I might want to bump up the number of triangles a bit more maybe, but I still think that less will be more with these.

The only other topic that I would also like to expand on more for now is just Linux content as the only minor diversion from this.
