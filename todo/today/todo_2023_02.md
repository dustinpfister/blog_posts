# todo list for FEB 2023

THREEJS, VIDEOGROUND-BETA-WORLD

I would like to keep staying in my lane with threejs, only branching off into other subjects that might be loosely related to threejs. I would also like to stop neglecting my beta world videoground project which means experimenting more with different kinds of video content.

## YOUTUBE
* () update youtube github video links from threejs-ambient-light
