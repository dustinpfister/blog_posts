# todo list for MARCH 2023

VIDEOGROUND-BETA-WORLD, THREEJS

I would like to focus on my beta world content first and formost. When doing so I will end up having to create custom module that I can then write about in terms of new blog posts.

I would like to finish 'breathing basic' and while doing so start some prototypes for projects that I will be using with this video as well as future projects based off of it. I have two general ideas for additional threes example projects one has to do with having one or more planes positioned in front of the camera, and the other has to do with alpha values. I currently have alpha methods baked into my curve and sequence hook modules, but I think that I should just have these in there own module and remove this from future revisions of those projects.
