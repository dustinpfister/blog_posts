# todo list for MARCH 2023

VIDEOGROUND-BETA-WORLD, THREEJS

I would like to focus on my beta world content first and formost. When doing so I will end up having to create custom module that I can then write about in terms of new blog posts.

## () - WEEK 4 - SUN 03/19/2023 - SAT 03/25/2023

This week I would like to work on my tracks module. I think it will be a pretty cool project if I can just improve the quality of the code a little. So I will be making that the top item each day this week, and maybe event for the rest of the month if need be. After that I have some ideas for protoypes that might apply to what I want to do with tracks, as well as other future projects.

<!-- forpost/ tracks r1 and demos -->
* () forpost: threejs-examples-tracks - work on R1 of the module.

## () - WEEK 2 - SUN 03/05/2023 - SAT 03/11/2023

I would like to finish 'breathing basic' and while doing so start some prototypes for projects that I will be using with this video as well as future projects based off of it. I have two general ideas for additional threes example projects one has to do with having one or more planes positioned in front of the camera, and the other has to do with alpha values. I currently have alpha methods baked into my curve and sequence hook modules, but I think that I should just have these in there own module and remove this from future revisions of those projects.
