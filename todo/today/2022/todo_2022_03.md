# todo list for March 2022

LINUX, ELECTRON.JS

So it looks like my content on Linux is growing, as such I should take a moment to expand on that just for that reason alone of course. However also regardless it is a topic that I think I can really get behind also at a personal level regardless of how well the content is preforming. Linux goes far beyond just being an operating system kernel, for example there are the legal reasons why Linux is great. There is the whole Linux is free as in free beer angle when it comes to not having to pay and arm and a leg for software licensing. However there is also the Linux is free as in free speech angle also. Anyone can just pull down the source code, make improvements, and republish as lng as that code is released under the terms of a similar license to that of the GPL.

## new posts
* new content on Linux as that seems to be doing well, and I would like to expand on that regardless
* new js cat posts on typical javaScript prototype project as needed

## editing 
* light editing of js posts, mainly long form posts only
* continue with lodash, but also just light touch up type edits, no long form posts for now with lodash

So then a single day might look something like this
```
* new post on election
* todo-long-from-js one item
* todo-edit-lodash one item
* work on linux proto folder project on a command, or linux feature
```
