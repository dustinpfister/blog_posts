New post for my next digital art javaScript example, as well as more editing of js and lodash posts. One more additional post on lodash for Friday as well if there is something more to expand on with that is I continue to edit my lodash content.

In terms of actual projects I am going to want to stick to creating very simple projects where I can complete the MVP in a few days,if not even a few Hours even.

For the first week of the money I wrote and edited by first blog post for the year that is my usual plan for the new year post that I do every year. On top of that I did a fair amount of editing with lodash posts, as as as js posts.

During this time I also worked on a number of javaScript example prototypes, improving the one that I started late last year, as well as starting some new ones.
