# todo list for FEB 2022

This Month I think the focus needs to be on expanding on three.js, as that content seems to be doing well, and I have spent enough time away from it anyway.

## new posts
* new posts on threejs for each
* start a new repository for election.js posts that I might start writing on at some poijt thie year
* new content on Linux as that seems to be doing well, and I would like to expand on that regardless
* new posts on js examples, but only as needed and the focus should be more so on this other topics for new content at least

## editing 
* threejs - main focus of editing for the month, edit any posts as needed
* linux - edit posts as needed when writing new posts
* js - edit only a few posts 5-10, over the course of the whole month for now
* lodash - also just a few posts, 5-10, over the course of the month

So then a single day might look something like this
```
* new post on election
* todo-long-from-js one item
* todo-edit-lodash one item
* work on linux proto folder project on a command, or linux feature
```
