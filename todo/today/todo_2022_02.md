# todo list for FEB 2022

This is what I am planing out for February of 2022 in terms of what I would like to get done with new blog posts, editing of older posts, as well as various source code examples and projects that I write about in such blog posts.

## new posts

* start a new category of content on election.js
* new content on Linux as that seems to be doing well, and I would like to expand on that regardless

## editing 
* continue editing js category content, but just with quick touch up work one post at a time
* continue with a general edit of lodash

So then a single day might look something like this
```
* new post on election
* todo-long-from-js one item
* todo-edit-lodash one item
* work on linux proto folder project on a command, or linux feature
```
