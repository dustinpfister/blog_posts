# todo list for Augest 2023

Position editor, 'tri16 project', videoground, THREEJS, Linux

This month the main this I would like to work on is a new electionjs app that will be used to create JSON data to use in threejs projects. Speaking of such I would also like to start a whole collection of content where I aim to make very low polly modules of no more than 16 triangles. I all ready have a few examples of this kind of model in my test threejs repo, but I would like to make more of them.

After that more than the ushual with threejs demos, content, with a little new content on the subject of Linux topics.
