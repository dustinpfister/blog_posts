# todo list for JUNE 2023

Linux, THREEJS

I will have to keep staying in my lane with threejs of course. However at this time I should also expand, and edit Linux content at least a little as well now. Linux is has a much wider user base, so there is the potential of more traffic. However in any case I use Linux every day, there is much more for me to learn about it, so it just makes sense to do more research, write more content, and improve the older content I have written thus far.
