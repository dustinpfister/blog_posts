# todo list for Oct 2022

THREEJS, VIDEOGROUND-BLOG-POSTS, VIDEOGROUND

For yet another month the plan is to continue staying in my late with threejs. With that said I think the main thing I will focus on it to continue with what I started late last month, which it to focus on my top ten posts in terms of clicks.

This is the current list as of 09/26/2022

## () - WEEK 3 - SUN 10/09/2022 to SAT 10/15/2022

I will want to try to keep the focus on editing one of the top ten posts per week. At this time that would mean my post on canvas textures. There is also as always what I will be writing about for my new post on Friday. I would like to try to not let to much more pull my attention away from those two things this week.

So then the main things to get done this week are
    * prototype and for post folder for Fridays post
    * new examples, video2, and editing of the threejs-canvas-textures post

Other tasks should be limited and only done after I put at least a little time into the above
    * make and publish video1 videos for posts that do not have them yet
    * work on the theme of the site, at least have a new static background
