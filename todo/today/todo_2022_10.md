# todo list for Oct 2022

THREEJS, VIDEOGROUND-BLOG-POSTS, VIDEOGROUND

For yet another month the plan is to contine staying in my late with threejs. With that said I think the main thing I will focus on it to continue with what I started late last month, which it to focus on my top ten posts in terms of clicks.

This is the current list as of 09/26/2022

## () - WEEK 1 - SAT 10/01/2022 to SAT 10/30/2022

This first week of the month is just one day, and it is on a saterday so I will not be getting much done for this one. I think that main thing I would like to focus on each day at this time out be my new animaiton loop framework though.
