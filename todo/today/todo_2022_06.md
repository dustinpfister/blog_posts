# todo list for June 2022

VIDEOGROUND-BETAWORLD, VIDEOGROUND-BLOGPOSTS, VIDEOGROUND, THREEJS

The general idea is to stay in my lane with threejs, and to focus more so on making videos rather than new posts and editing. I will still want to work on editing my older posts on threejs, and also write at least one new post per week on threejs also. However I want to start to shift the bulk of my screen time in the direction of making video projects that are a little more engaging rather than just blog post demo videos.
