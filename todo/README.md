# todo lists for blog_posts

I have started this folder out of a need to do a better job planing out what should happen in terms of improving the quality of content, as well as what I should be looking into next when it comes to writing new content. This repository also does not just hold the mark down files of my website, but also a number of tools that I use to preform various tasks with the collection of content. Many of these tools need additional work, or maybe even a bottom up overhaul actually. So one crude yet effective way of doing this would be to just have simple todo lists, and just start scratching things off for what it is worth, this folder is then a collection of such files.

There are three general categories of todo lists for this repository.

* todo lists that have to do with editing content that was all ready written
* todo lists on planing out new content
* todo lists the outline what needs to be added, or changed in terms of scripts, and tools

In time there is also maybe working out some kind of over all system that has to do with automating the process of creating and updating lists. However for starters I am just going to be doing this manually, which might be a good idea for now as I still do not have a grand overall system in mind just yet anyway which I would need to have in order to make such a tool.
