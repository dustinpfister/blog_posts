# todo lists for blog_posts

I have started this folder out of a need to do a better job planing out what should happen in terms of improving the quality of content, as well as what I should be looking into next when it comes to writing new content. This repository also does not just hold the mark down files of my website, but also a number of tools that I use to preform various tasks with the collection of content. Many of these tools need additional work, or maybe even a bottom up overhaul actually. So one crude yet effective way of doing this would be to just have simple todo lists, and just start scratching things off for what it is worth, this folder is then a collection of such files.

## Categories of lists

There are three general categories of todo lists for this repository.

* todo lists that have to do with editing content that was all ready written but needs additional work
* todo lists on planing out new content
* todo lists the outline what needs to be added, or changed in terms of scripts, and tools

In time there is also maybe working out some kind of over all system that has to do with automating the process of creating and updating lists. However for starters I am just going to be doing this manually, which might be a good idea for now as I still do not have a grand overall system in mind just yet anyway which I would need to have in order to make such a tool.

### Editing

When it comes to editing older content there is more than one idea when it comes to how it is that I should go about prioritizing content. So then editing content can be split down into more than one kind of list:

* prioritize content to edit based on how much traffic it is getting currently ( search console clicks, analytics traffic )
* prioritize content to edit based on how much traffic it can potential get ( search console impressions, goggle trends keywords)
* prioritize content to edit based just on 'intrinsic value' ( just an interesting or fun topic )
* prioritize content to edit based just on poor state of content ( under 500 words, poorly written, ect )
* prioritize content to edit based on how long it has been sense the last edit ( have not edited in over a year or longer)

The same can also be said when it comes to making choices about what directions I should be going in when it comes to learning, and writing about something new.
